/**
 * Proposed backend API changes for transactions.
 * <h2>TODO</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>long running backend primitives (deleteSubtree, renameSubtree,
 * and search) need to handle operation cancelation. This was
 * previously done using the Operation class. Should the cancelation
 * handler be defined by the transaction configuration, rather than
 * per primitive?
 * <li>how should transaction timeouts be managed?
 * <li>how should deadlocks be managed? Is DirectoryException enough?
 * <li>how will ensure that re-entrant code re-uses existing txn
 * context? For example, access control checks accessing the entry
 * being modified via an internal operation or
 * DirectoryServer.getEntry(DN).
 * </ul>
