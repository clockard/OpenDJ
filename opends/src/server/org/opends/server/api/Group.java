 *   <LI>Determining whether a given user is a member of this
 *       group</LI>
 *   <LI>Determining the set of members for this group, optionally
 *       filtered based on some set of criteria.</LI>
 *   <LI>Retrieving or updating the set of nested groups for this
 *       group, if the underlying group type supports nesting).</LI>
 *   <LI>Updating the set of members for this group, if the underlying
 *       group type provides the ability to explicitly add or remove
 *       members.</LI>
