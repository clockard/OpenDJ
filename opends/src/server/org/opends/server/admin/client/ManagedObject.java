/**
 * A generic interface for accessing client-side managed objects.
 * <p>
 * A managed object comprises of zero or more properties. A property
 * has associated with it three sets of property value(s). These are:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>default value(s)</i> - these value(s) represent the
 * default behavior for the property when it has no active values.
 * When a property inherits its default value(s) from elsewhere (i.e.
 * a property in another managed object), the default value(s)
 * represent the active value(s) of the inherited property at the time
 * the managed object was retrieved
 * <li><i>active value(s)</i> - these value(s) represent the state
 * of the property at the time the managed object was retrieved
 * <li><i>pending value(s)</i> - these value(s) represent any
 * modifications made to the property's value(s) since the managed
 * object object was retrieved and before the changes have been
 * committed using the {@link #commit()} method, the pending values
 * can be empty indicating that the property should be modified back
 * to its default values.
 * </ul>
 * In addition, a property has an <i>effective state</i> defined by
 * its <i>effective values</i> which are derived by evaluating the
 * following rules in the order presented:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the <i>pending values</i> if defined and non-empty
 * <li>or, the <i>default values</i> if the pending values are
 * defined but are empty
 * <li>or, the <i>active values</i> if defined and non-empty
 * <li>or, the <i>default values</i> if there are no active values
 * <li>or, an empty set of values, if there are no default values.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <C>
 *          The type of client configuration represented by the client
 *          managed object.
