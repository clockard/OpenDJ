  <adm:TODO>
    The key manager must be able to get a pin from somewhere. It looks
    in property, then an environment variable, then a file, and finally
    in a configuration attribute. At least one must be present. Can we
    express this ordering and this "at least one" constraint? Perhaps
    support a "one-of" element which can be used to group a set of
    properties.
  </adm:TODO>
  <adm:synopsis>
    The
    <adm:user-friendly-name />
    provider provides the ability for the server to access the private
    key information through the PKCS11 interface. This standard
    interface is used by cryptographic accelerators and hardware
    security modules.
