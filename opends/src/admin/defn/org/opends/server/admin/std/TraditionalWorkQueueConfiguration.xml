  <adm:synopsis>
    The
    <adm:user-friendly-name />
    is a type of work queue that uses a number of worker threads that
    watch a queue and pick up an operation to process whenever one
    becomes available.
  </adm:synopsis>
  <adm:description>
    The traditional work queue is named that because its implementation 
    is similar to that used by the Sun Java System Directory Server. 
    The traditional work queue is a FIFO queue serviced by a fixed 
    number of worker threads. However, there are a couple of notable 
    differences in its design: 1) The number of worker threads is fixed, 
    but it can be changed on the fly and those changes take effect 
    immediately. In the Sun Java System Directory Server, changes to the 
    number of worker threads require a server restart to take effect. 
    2) The work queue in the Sun Java System Directory Server is 
    unbounded. If all threads are busy processing existing operations 
    and new requests arrive, they continue to accumulate in the work 
    queue and the server appears to be frozen. In the OpenDS Directory 
    Server, it is possible to place a size limit on the work queue. 
    When this number of operations are in the queue, waiting to be 
    picked up by threads, any new requests received are rejected with 
    an error message.

    <adm:description>
      If the work queue is already full and additional requests are
      received by the server, the requests are rejected.
      A value of zero indicates that there is no limit to the size 
      of the queue.
