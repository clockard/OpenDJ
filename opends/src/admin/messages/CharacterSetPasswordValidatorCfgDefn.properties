user-friendly-name=Character Set Password Validator
user-friendly-plural-name=Character Set Password Validators
synopsis=The Character Set Password Validator determines whether a proposed password is acceptable by checking whether it contains a sufficient number of characters from one or more user-defined character sets.
description=For example, the validator can ensure that passwords must have at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one symbol.
property.allow-unclassified-characters.synopsis=Indicates whether this password validator allows passwords to contain characters outside of any of the user-defined character sets.
property.allow-unclassified-characters.description=If this is "false", then only those characters in the user-defined character sets may be used in passwords. Any password containing a character not included in any character set will be rejected.
property.character-set.synopsis=Specifies a character set containing characters that a password may contain and a value indicating the minimum number of characters required from that set.
property.character-set.description=Each value must be an integer (indicating the minimum required characters from the set which may be zero, indicating that the character set is optional) followed by a colon and the characters to include in that set (for example, "3:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" indicates that a user password must contain at least three characters from the set of lowercase ASCII letters). Multiple character sets can be defined in separate values, although no character can appear in more than one character set.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the password validator is enabled for use.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the password validator implementation.
property.min-character-sets.synopsis=Specifies the minimum number of character sets that a password must contain.
property.min-character-sets.description=This property should only be used in conjunction with optional character sets (those requiring zero characters). Its value must include any mandatory character sets (those requiring great than zero characters). This is useful in situations where a password must contain characters from mandatory character sets, and characters from at least N optional character sets. For example, it is quite common to require that a password contains at least one non-alphanumeric character as well as characters from two alphanumeric character sets (lower-case, upper-case, digits). In this case, this property should be set to 3.
property.min-character-sets.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=The password must contain characters from each of the mandatory character sets and, if there are optional character sets, at least one character from one of the optional character sets.
