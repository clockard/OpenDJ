synopsis=The Work Queue provides the configuration for the server work queue and is responsible for ensuring that requests received from clients are processed in a timely manner.
description=Only a single work queue can be defined in the server. Whenever a connection handler receives a client request, it should place the request in the work queue to be processed appropriately.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the Work Queue implementation.
property.max-psearches.synopsis=Defines the maximum number of concurrent persistent searches that can be performed on Directory Server
property.max-psearches.description=The persistent search mechanism provides an active channel through which entries that change, and information about the changes that occur, can be communicated. Because each persistent search operation uses one thread, limiting the number of simultaneous persistent searches prevents certain kinds of denial of service attacks. A value of 0 indicates that there is no limit on the persistent searches.
property.max-psearches.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=Let the server decide.
