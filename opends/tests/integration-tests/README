The functional test suite, also known as the acceptance test suite,
will eventually be a standalone library from the Directory Server.

Thus the build environment was kept completely separate from that
for Directory Server.

To run the functional test suite from a fresh check out, the following
steps will be necessary.

1. Build the DirectoryServer.jar in the build process for Directory
Server. This is of course not necessary if you already have
a DirectoryServer.jar.

2. Copy the ext and the lib sub-directories from the Directory Server
build environment to the functional-test directory.

3. Copy the DirectoryServer.jar into the functional-tests/lib
directory.

4. Edit the file, src/com/sun/directory/DirectoryServerAcceptanceTestCase.java,
with the appropriate directory paths and variable values.

5. Run ./build.sh

6. Ensure that your java classpath includes junit.jar, je.jar,
the new DirectoryServer.jar, and the directory where the 
functional test classes reside.

7. Execute the functional tests with the command
java com.sun.directory.DirectoryServerAcceptanceTestSuite
