/**
 * A connection factory provides an interface for obtaining a connection
 * to a Directory Server. Connection factories can be used to wrap other
 * connection factories in order to provide enhanced capabilities in a
 * manner which is transparent to the application. For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Connection pooling
 * <li>Load balancing
 * <li>Keep alive
 * <li>Transactional connections
 * <li>Connections to LDIF files
 * <li>Data transformations
 * <li>Logging connections
 * <li>Read-only connections
 * <li>Pre-authenticated connections
 * <li>Recording connections, with primitive roll-back functionality
 * </ul>
 * An application typically obtains a connection from a connection
 * factory, performs one or more operations, and then closes the
 * connection. Applications should aim to close connections as soon as
 * possible in order to avoid resource contention.
