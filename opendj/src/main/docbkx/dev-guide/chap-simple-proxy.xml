 <title>Writing a Simple LDAP Proxy</title>
 <indexterm>
  <primary>LDAP</primary>
  <secondary>Proxy</secondary>
 </indexterm>

 <para>The OpenDJ LDAP SDK <link xlink:show="new"
 xlink:href="http://opendj.forgerock.org/opendj-ldap-sdk-examples/xref/org/forgerock/opendj/examples/Proxy.html"
 >example Proxy</link> demonstrates a simple LDAP proxy that forwards requests
 to one or more remote directory servers. Although the implementation is
 intended as an example, it does demonstrate use of the asynchronous API,
 load balancing, and connection pooling.</para>
 <indexterm>
  <primary>Connections</primary>
  <secondary>Asynchronous</secondary>
 </indexterm>

 <para>The Proxy example sets up connections pools with load balancing to the
 directory servers. It passes the connection factories to a
 <literal>ProxyBackend</literal> that handles the requests passed back
 to the directory servers. It also sets up an LDAP listener to receive incoming
 connections from clients of the Proxy.</para>

 <para>The <literal>ProxyBackend</literal> uses separate connection factories,
 one for bind operations, the other for other operations. It uses the proxied
 authorization control to ensure operations are performed using the bind
 identity for the operation.</para>

 <para>The <literal>ProxyBackend</literal>'s function is to handle each client
 request, encapsulating the result handlers that allow it to deal with each
 basic operation. It authenticates to the directory server to check incoming
 credentials, and adds the proxied authorization control to requests other than
 binds. The <literal>ProxyBackend</literal> handles all operations using
 asynchronous connections and methods.</para>

 <section xml:id="connection-pooling">
  <title>Connection Pooling</title>
  <indexterm>
   <primary>Connections</primary>
   <secondary>Pooling</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>As shown in the Proxy example, the
  <literal>Connections.newFixedConnectionPool()</literal> returns a connection
  pool of the maximum size you specify.</para>

  <programlisting language="java"
  >[jcp:org.forgerock.opendj.examples.Proxy:--- JCite pools ---]</programlisting>

  <para>Connections are returned to the pool when you <literal>close()</literal>
  them. Notice that <literal>Connections</literal> also provides methods to
  return <literal>ConnectionFactory</literal>s with a heart beat check on
  connections provided by the factory, and connection factories that
  authenticate connections before returning them.</para>

  <para>Connections in the pool are intended for reuse. The Proxy gets an
  authenticated connection, which is a connection where the OpenDJ LDAP
  SDK passes a bind request immediately when getting the connection. The Proxy
  then uses proxied authorization to handle the identity from the client
  requesting the operation. As a rule, either handle binds separately and use
  proxied authorization as in the Proxy example, or else make sure that the
  first operation on a connection retrieved from the pool is a bind that
  correctly authenticates the user currently served by the connection.</para>

  <para>When you <literal>close()</literal> a connection from the pool, the
  OpenDJ LDAP SDK does not perform an <literal>unbind()</literal>. This is why
  you must be careful about how you manage authentication on connections from a
  pool.</para>

 <section xml:id="load-balancing-and-failover">
  <title>Load Balancing &amp; Failover</title>
  <indexterm>
   <primary>Connections</primary>
   <secondary>Load balancing</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>The <literal>Connections.newLoadBalancer()</literal> method returns a
  load balancer based on the algorithm you choose. Algorithms include both
  round robin for equitably sharing load across local directory servers, and
  also failover usually used for switching automatically from an unresponsive
  server group to an alternative server group. The algorithms take collections
  of connection factories, such as those that you set up for connection
  pooling.</para>

  <para>The following excerpt shows how to set up round robin load balancing
  across directory servers.</para>

  <programlisting language="java"
  >[jcp:org.forgerock.opendj.examples.Proxy:--- JCite load balancer ---]</programlisting>

  <para>With multiple pools of directory servers, for example in a deployment
  across multiple data centers, also use fail over load balancing. Fail over
  load balancing directs all requests to the first (preferred) pool of servers
  until problems are encountered with the connections to that pool. Then it
  fails over to the next pool in the list. Therefore in each data center you
  can set up round robin load balancing, and then set up fail over load
  balancing across data centers.</para>

  <programlisting language="java"
  >// localFactory:  ConnectionFactory to servers in the local data center
// remoteFactory: ConnectionFactory for servers in a remote data center
// localFactory and remoteFactory use round robin load balancing "internally".

final List&lt;ConnectionFactory&gt; factories =
        Arrays.asList(localFactory, remoteFactory);

final FailoverLoadBalancingAlgorithm algorithm =
        new FailoverLoadBalancingAlgorithm(factories);

final ConnectionFactory factory = Connections.newLoadBalancer(algorithm);</programlisting>

  <para>The algorithms also include constructors that let you adjust timeouts
  and so forth.</para>

  <title>Listening For &amp; Handling Client Connections</title>
  <indexterm>
   <primary>Connections</primary>
   <secondary>Listening for</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>You create an <literal>LDAPListener</literal> to handle incoming client
  connections. The <literal>LDAPListener</literal> takes a connection handler
  that deals with the connections, in this case connections back to the
  directory servers handling client requests.</para>

  <programlisting language="java"
  >[jcp:org.forgerock.opendj.examples.Proxy:--- JCite listener ---]</programlisting>

  <para>
   The connection handler is a <literal>ServerConnectionFactory</literal>
   to handle requests coming from clients.
   The factory takes a request handler implementation
   that deals with all supported incoming client requests.
   The Proxy example uses a <literal>ProxyBackend</literal> to handle requests.
   The <literal>ProxyBackend</literal> sends the requests on
   to the backend directory servers
   and routes the results returned back to client applications.

  <title>DN &amp; Attribute Rewriting</title>
  <indexterm>
   <primary>Attributes</primary>
   <secondary>Rewriting</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>Suppose you have a client application that expects a different
  attribute name, such as <literal>fullname</literal> for a standard attribute
  like <literal>cn</literal> (common name), and that expects a distinguished
  name (DN) suffix different from what is stored in the directory. If you
  cannot change the application, one possible alternative is a proxy layer
  that does DN and attribute rewriting.<footnote><para>Some servers, such as
  OpenDJ directory server, can do attribute rewriting without a proxy layer.
  See your directory server's documentation for details.</para></footnote></para>
