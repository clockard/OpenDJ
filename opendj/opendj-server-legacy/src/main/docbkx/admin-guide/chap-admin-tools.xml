 <title>Administration Interfaces &amp; Tools</title>

 <para>OpenDJ server software installs with a cross-platform, Java Swing-based
 Control Panel for many day-to-day tasks. OpenDJ server software also installs
 command-line tools for configuration and management tasks.</para>
 
 <para>This chapter is one of the few to include screen shots of the control
 panel. Most examples make use of the command-line tools. Once you understand
 the concepts, and how to perform a task using the command-line tools, you
 no doubt need no more than to know where to start in the Control Panel to
 accomplish what you set out to do.</para>

 <para>At a protocol level, administration tools and interfaces connect to
 servers through a different network port than that used to listen for traffic
 from other client applications.</para>
 
 <para>This chapter takes a quick look at the tools for managing directory
 services.</para>
 
 <section xml:id="control-panel">
  <title>Control Panel</title>
  <indexterm><primary>Control panel</primary></indexterm>
  <para>OpenDJ Control Panel offers a graphical user interface for
  managing both local and remote servers. You choose the server to manage
  when you start the Control Panel. The Control Panel connects to the
  administration server port, making a secure LDAPS connection.</para>

  <para>When you login to OpenDJ Control Panel, you authenticate over LDAP.
  This means that if users can run the Control Panel, they can use it to manage
  a running server. Yet, to start and stop the server process through OpenDJ
  Control Panel, you must start the Control Panel on the system where OpenDJ
  runs, as the user who owns the OpenDJ server files (such as the user who
  installed OpenDJ). In other words, the OpenDJ Control Panel does not do
  remote process management.</para>

   <para>Down the left side of OpenDJ Control Panel, notice what you can
   configure.</para>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Directory Data</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>Directory data provisioning is typically not something you do
     by hand in most deployments. Usually entries are created, modified, and
     deleted through specific directory client applications. The Manage
     Entries window can be useful, however, both in the lab as you design
     and test directory data, and also if you modify individual ACIs or
     debug issues with particular entries.</para>
     <mediaobject xml:id="figure-manage-entries">
      <imageobject>
       <imagedata fileref="images/Manage-Entries.png" format="PNG" />
      </imageobject>
      <caption><para>The Manage Entries window can check that your changes are
     valid before sending the request to the directory.</para></caption>
     </mediaobject>
     <para>Additionally, the Directory Data list makes it easy to create
     a new base DN, and then import user data for the new base DN from LDIF.
     You can also use the tools in the list to export user data to LDIF,
     and to backup and restore user data.</para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Schema</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>The Manage Schema window lets you browse and modify the rules
     that define how data is stored in the directory. You can add new schema
     definitions such as new attribute types and new object classes while the
     server is running, and the changes you make take effect immediately.</para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Indexes</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>The Manage Indexes window gives you a quick overview of all
     the indexes currently maintained for directory attributes. To protect
     your directory resources from being absorbed by costly searches on
     unindexed attributes, you may choose to keep the default behavior,
     preventing unindexed searches, instead adding indexes required by specific
     applications. (Notice that if the number of user data entries is smaller
     than the default resource limits, you can still perform what appear
     to be unindexed searches. That is because the <literal>dn2id</literal>
     index returns all user data entries without hitting a resource limit that
     would make the search unindexed.)</para>
     <para>OpenDJ Control Panel also allows you to verify and rebuild
     existing indexes, which you may have to do after an upgrade operation,
     or if you have reason to suspect index corruption.</para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Monitoring</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>The Monitoring list gives you windows to observe information
     about the system, the JVM used, and indications about how the cache is
     used, whether the work queue has been filling up, as well as details
     about the database. You can also view the numbers and types of requests
     arriving over the connection handlers, and the current tasks in progress
     as well.</para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Runtime Options</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>If you did not set appropriate JVM runtime options during the
     installation process, this is the list that allows you to do so through
     the Control Panel.</para>
