/**
 * An asynchronous connection with a Directory Server over which read and update
 * operations may be performed. See RFC 4511 for the LDAPv3 protocol
 * specification and more information about the types of operations defined in
 * LDAP.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Operation processing</h3>
 * <p>
 * All operations are performed asynchronously and return a {@link FutureResult}
 * or sub-type thereof which can be used for retrieving the result using the
 * {@link FutureResult#get} method. Operation failures, for whatever reason, are
 * signalled by the {@link FutureResult#get()} method throwing an
 * {@link ErrorResultException}.
 * <p>
 * Synchronous operations are easily simulated by immediately getting the
 * result:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Connection connection = ...;
 * AddRequest request = ...;
 * // Will block until operation completes, and
 * // throws exception on failure.
 * connection.add(request).get();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Operations can be performed in parallel while taking advantage of the
 * simplicity of a synchronous application design:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Connection connection1 = ...;
 * Connection connection2 = ...;
 * AddRequest request = ...;
 * // Add the entry to the first server (don't block).
 * FutureResult future1 = connection1.add(request);
 * // Add the entry to the second server (in parallel).
 * FutureResult future2 = connection2.add(request);
 * // Total time = is O(1) instead of O(n).
 * future1.get();
 * future2.get();
 * </pre>
 *
 * More complex client applications can take advantage of a fully asynchronous
 * event driven design using {@link ResultHandler}s:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Connection connection = ...;
 * SearchRequest request = ...;
 * // Process results in the search result handler
 * // in a separate thread.
 * SearchResponseHandler handle = ...;
 * connection.search(request, handler);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Closing connections</h3>
 * <p>
 * Applications must ensure that a connection is closed by calling
 * {@link #close()} even if a fatal error occurs on the connection. Once a
 * connection has been closed by the client application, any attempts to
 * continue to use the connection will result in an
 * {@link IllegalStateException} being thrown. Note that, if a fatal error is
 * encountered on the connection, then the application can continue to use the
 * connection. In this case all requests subsequent to the failure will fail
 * with an appropriate {@link ErrorResultException} when their result is
 * retrieved.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Event notification</h3>
 * <p>
 * Applications can choose to be notified when a connection is closed by the
 * application, receives an unsolicited notification, or experiences a fatal
 * error by registering a {@link ConnectionEventListener} with the connection
 * using the {@link #addConnectionEventListener} method.
 *
 * @see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511">RFC 4511 - Lightweight
 *      Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol </a>
