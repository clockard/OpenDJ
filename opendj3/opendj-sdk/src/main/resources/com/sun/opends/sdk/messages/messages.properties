INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_DENIED_CLIENTS=Specifies a set of \
 address masks that can be used to determine the set of addresses of the \
 clients that are not allowed to establish connections to this connection \
 handler.  If both allowed and denied client masks are defined and a client \
 connection matches one or more masks in both lists, then the connection will \
 be denied.  If only a denied list is specified, then any client not matching \
 a mask in that list will be allowed.  Changes to this configuration attribute \
 will take effect immediately but will not interfere with connections that might \
 already be established
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_ALLOW_LDAPV2=Indicates whether to allow \
 communication with LDAPv2 clients.  LDAPv2 is considered an obsolete \
 protocol, and clients using it will not be allowed to take advantage of all \
 features offered by the server.  Changes to this configuration attribute will \
 take effect immediately, but will not interfere with connections that might \
 already be established
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_NUM_REQUEST_HANDLERS=Number of threads \

 reading requests from clients.  Changes to this configuration attribute will \
 not take effect until the connection handler is disabled and re-enabled, or \
 until the Directory Server is restarted

 to send an LDAPv3 notice of disconnection message to client connections that \
 are rejected before closing the connection.  Changes to this configuration \
 attribute will take effect immediately
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_USE_TCP_KEEPALIVE=Indicates whether to \
 use the TCP KeepAlive feature for client connections established through this \
 connection handler.  This is recommended because it might help the server \
 detect client connections that are no longer valid, and might help prevent \
 intermediate network devices from closing connections due to a lack of \
 communication.  Changes to this configuration attribute will take effect \
 immediately but will only be applied to connections established after the \
 change
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_USE_TCP_NODELAY=Indicates whether to \
 use the TCP NoDelay feature for client connections established through this \
 connection handler.  This is recommended because it will generally allow \
 faster responses to clients, although directories that frequently process \
 searches that match multiple entries might be able to achieve higher throughput \
 if it is disabled.  Changes to this configuration attribute will take effect \
 immediately but will only be applied to connections established after the \
 change
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_ALLOW_REUSE_ADDRESS=Indicates whether \
 to use the SO_REUSEADDR socket option for the socket accepting connections \
 for this connection handler.  It should generally be enabled unless you have \
 been instructed to disable it by support engineers.  Changes to this \
 configuration attribute will not take effect until the connection handler is \
 disabled and re-enabled, or until the Directory Server is restarted
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE=Maximum \
 size in bytes that will be allowed when reading requests from clients.  This \
 can be used to prevent denial of service attacks from clients that send \
 extremely large requests.  A value of zero indicates that no limit should be \
 imposed.  Changes to this configuration attribute will take effect \
 immediately
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_USE_SSL=Indicates whether this \
 connection handler should use SSL when accepting connections from clients. \
 Changes to this configuration attribute will not take effect until the \
 connection handler is disabled and re-enabled, or until the Directory Server \
 is restarted
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_ALLOW_STARTTLS=Indicates whether this \
 connection handler should allow clients to use the StartTLS extended \
 operation to initiate secure communication over a non-SSL LDAP connection. \
 This can not be used if SSL is enabled for the connection handler.  Changes \
 to this configuration attribute will take effect immediately for LDAP clients
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_POLICY=Policy that \
 should be used regarding requesting or requiring the client to \
 present its own certificate when establishing an SSL-based connection or \
 using StartTLS to initiate a secure channel in an established connection. \
 Changes to this configuration attribute will not take effect until the \
 connection handler is disabled and re-enabled, or until the Directory Server \
 is restarted
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_SSL_CERT_NICKNAME=Nickname of the \
 certificate that the connection handler should use when \
 accepting SSL-based connections or performing StartTLS negotiation.  Changes \
 to this configuration attribute will not take effect until the connection \
 handler is disabled and re-enabled, or until the Directory Server is \
 restarted

INFO_AUTHRATE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION=This utility can be used to measure \

  used in the bind DN option as well as the authid and authzid SASL bind \
  options. A search operation may be used to retrieve the bind DN by \
  specifying the base DN and a filter. The retrieved entry DN will be appended \
  as the last argument in the argument list when evaluating format strings. \
  For example, to measure simple bind performance using the retrieved user \
  DN as the bind DN: authrate -D '%2$s' -p password -b "dc=example,dc=com" \
  -g 'rand(0,10000)' '(user=user.%1$d)'
