 <title>Managing Schema</title>

 <para>Schema definitions describe the data, and especially the object classes
 and attribute types that can be stored in the directory. By default OpenDJ
 conforms strictly to LDAPv3 standards pertaining to schema definitions and
 attribute syntax checking, ensuring that data stored is valid and properly
 formed. Unless your data use only standard schema present in OpenDJ when
 you install, then you must add additional schema definitions to account
 the data your applications stored.</para>
 
 <para>Out of the box, OpenDJ comes with many standard schema definitions.
 In addition you can update and extend schema definitions while OpenDJ
 is online. As a result you can add new applications requiring additional
 data without stopping your directory service.</para>
 
 <para>This chapter demonstrates how to change and to extend OpenDJ schema.
 This chapter also identifies the standard schema definitions available when
 you install OpenDJ.</para>
