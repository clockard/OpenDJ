 <title>Searching &amp; Comparing Directory Data</title>

 <para>Traditionally directories excel at serving read requests. This chapter
 covers the read (search and compare) capabilities that OpenDJ LDAP Java SDK
 provides. The data used in examples here is <link xlink:show="new"

  <itemizedlist>
   <para>An LDAP search looks up entries based on the following
   parameters.</para>
   <listitem>
    <para>A <firstterm>filter</firstterm> that indicates which attribute values
    to match</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>A <firstterm>base DN</firstterm> that specifies where in the
    directory information tree to look for matches</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>A <firstterm>scope</firstterm> that defines how far to go under
    the base DN</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>A list of attributes to fetch for an entry when a match is
    found</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>For example, imagine you must write an application where users login
  using their email address and a password. After the user logs in, your
  application displays the user's full name so it is obvious who is logged in.
  Your application is supposed to go to the user directory both for
  authentication, and also to read user profile information. You are told the
  user directory stores user profile entries under base DN
  <literal>ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</literal>, that email addresses are
  stored on the standard <literal>mail</literal> attribute, and full names are
  store on the standard <literal>cn</literal> attribute.</para>
  
  <para>You figure out how to authenticate from the chapter on <link
  xlink:href="dev-guide#chap-authenticating"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink">authentication</link>,
  in which you learn you need a bind DN and a password to do simple
  authentication. But how do you find the bind DN given the email? How do you
  get the full name?</para>
  
  <para>The answer to both questions is that you do an LDAP search for the
  user's entry, which has the DN that you use to bind, and you have the server
  fetch the <literal>cn</literal> attribute in the results. Your search uses
  the following parameters.</para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>The filter is
    <literal>(mail=<replaceable>emailAddress</replaceable>)</literal>, where
    <replaceable>emailAddress</replaceable> is the email address the user
    provided.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>The base DN is the one given to you,
    <literal>ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</literal>.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>For the scope, you figure the user entry is somewhere under the base
    DN, so you opt to search the whole subtree.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>The attribute to fetch is <literal>cn</literal>.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>The following code excerpt demonstrates how this might be done in a
  minimal command-line program.</para>

  <programlisting language="java">// Prompt for mail and password.
Console c = System.console();
if (c == null) {
    System.err.println("No console.");
    System.exit(1);
}

String mail = c.readLine("Email address: ");
char[] password = c.readPassword("Password: ");

// Search using mail address, and then bind with the DN and password.
final LDAPConnectionFactory factory = new LDAPConnectionFactory(host,
        port);
Connection connection = null;
try {
    connection = factory.getConnection();

    // No explicit bind yet so we remain anonymous for now.
    SearchResultEntry entry = connection.searchSingleEntry(baseDN,
            SearchScope.WHOLE_SUBTREE, "(mail=" + mail + ")", "cn");
    DN bindDN = entry.getName();
    connection.bind(bindDN.toString(), password);

    String cn = entry.getAttribute("cn").firstValueAsString();
    System.out.println("Hello, " + cn + "!");
} catch (final ErrorResultException e) {
    System.err.println("Failed to bind.");
    System.exit(e.getResult().getResultCode().intValue());
    return;
} finally {
    if (connection != null) {
        connection.close();
    }
}</programlisting>

  <para>Directory servers organize entries somewhat like a file system.
  Directory data is often depicted as an upside-down tree.</para>

  <mediaobject xml:id="figure-ldap-tree">
   <alt>Directory data is often depicted as an upside-down tree.</alt>

    <para>This figure shows three levels, the base DN for the suffix, a couple
    of organizational units, and three user entries.</para>
   </textobject>
  </mediaobject>

  <para>In the figure shown above, entries are represented by the relevant
  parts of their DNs. The entry with DN <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>
  is the base entry for a suffix. Under the base entry, you see two
  organizational units, one for people, <literal>ou=People</literal>, the other
  for groups, <literal>ou=Groups</literal>. The entries for people include
  those of Babs Jensen, Kirsten Vaughan, and Sam Carter.</para>

  <para>When you are searching for a person's entry somewhere under
  <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>, you can start from
  <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>, from
  <literal>ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</literal>, or if you have enough
  information to pinpoint the user entry and only want to look up another
  attribute value for example, then directly from the entry such as
  <literal>cn=Babs Jensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</literal>. The DN of
  the entry where you choose to start the search is the base DN for the
  search.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <para>When searching, you also define the scope. Scope defines what entries
   the server considers when checking for entries that match your search.</para>
   <listitem>
    <para>For <literal>SearchScope.BASE_OBJECT</literal> the server considers
    only the base entry.</para>
    <para>This is the scope you use if you know the full DN of the object
    that interests you. For example, if your base DN points to Babs Jensen's
    entry, <literal>cn=Babs Jensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</literal>, and
    you want to read some of Babs's attributes, you would set scope to
    <literal>SearchScope.BASE_OBJECT</literal>.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>For <literal>SearchScope.SINGLE_LEVEL</literal> the server considers
    all entries directly below the base entry.</para>
    <para>You use this scope if for example you want to discover organizational
    units under <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>, or if you want to find
    people's entries and you know they are immediately under
    <literal>ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</literal>.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>For <literal>SearchScope.SUBORDINATES</literal> the server considers
    all entries below the base entry.</para>
    <para>This scope can be useful if you know that the base DN for your search
    is an entry that you do not want to match.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>For <literal>SearchScope.WHOLE_SUBTREE</literal> (default) the server
    considers the base entry and all entries below.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>In addition to a base DN and scope, a search request also calls for a
  search filter.</para>

  <para>When you look someone up in the telephone directory, you use the value
  of one attribute of a person's entry (last name), to recover the person's
  directory entry, which has other attributes (phone number, address). LDAP
  works the same way. In LDAP, search requests identify both the scope of the
  directory entries to consider (for example, all people or all organizations),
  and also the entries to retrieve based on some attribute value (for example,
  surname, mail address, phone number, or something else). The way you express
  the attribute value(s) to match is by using a search filter.</para>

  <para>LDAP search filters define what entries actually match your request.
  For example, the following simple equality filter says, "Match all entries
  that have a surname attribute (sn) value equivalent to Jensen."</para>

  <literallayout class="monospaced">(sn=Jensen)</literallayout>

  <para>When you pass the directory server this filter as part of your search
  request, the directory server checks the entries in scope for your search to
  see whether they match.<footnote><para>In fact, the directory server probably
  checks an index first, and might not even accept search requests unless it
  can use indexes to match your filter rather than checking all entries in
  scope.</para></footnote> If the directory server finds entries that match,
  it returns those entries as it finds them.</para>

  <para>The example, <literal>(sn=Jensen)</literal>, shows a string
  representation of the search filter. The OpenDJ LDAP SDK lets you express
  your filters as strings, or as <literal>Filter</literal> objects. In both
  cases, the SDK translates the strings and objects into the binary
  representation sent to the server over the network.</para>

  <para>Equality is just one of the types of comparisons available in LDAP
  filters. Comparison operators include the following.</para>

  <xinclude:include href="../shared/table-filter-operators.xml" />

  <para>When taking user input, take care to protect against users providing
  input that has unintended consequences. OpenDJ SDK offers several Filter
  methods to help you. First, you can use strongly typed construction methods
  such as <literal>Filter.equality()</literal>.</para>

  <programlisting language="java">String userInput = getUserInput();
Filter filter = Filter.equality("cn", userInput);

// Invoking filter.toString() with input of "*" results in a filter
// string "(cn=\2A)".</programlisting>

  <para>You can also let the SDK escape user input by using a template with
  <literal>Filter.format()</literal> as in the following example.</para>

  <programlisting language="java">String template = "(|(cn=%s)(uid=user.%s))";
String[] userInput = getUserInput();
Filter filter = Filter.format(template, userInput[0], userInput[1]);</programlisting>

  <para>Finally, you can explicitly escape user input with
  <literal>Filter.escapeAssertionValue()</literal>.</para>

  <programlisting language="java">String baseDN = "ou=people,dc=example,dc=com";
String userInput = getUserInput();

// Filter.escapeAssertionValue() transforms user input of "*" to "\2A".
SearchRequest request = Requests.newSearchRequest(
        baseDN, SearchScope.WHOLE_SUBTREE,
        "(cn=" + Filter.escapeAssertionValue(userInput) + "*)", "cn", "mail");</programlisting>

  <para>As shown in the following excerpt with a synchronous connection, you
  get a <literal>Connection</literal> to the directory server from an
  <literal>LDAPConnectionFactory</literal>.</para>

  <programlisting language="java"

    // Handle exceptions...
} finally {
    if (connection != null) {
        connection.close();
    }
}</programlisting>

  <para>The <literal>Connection</literal> gives you <literal>search()</literal>
  methods that either take parameters in the style of the
  <command>ldapsearch</command> command, or that take a
  <literal>SearchRequest</literal> object. If you are sure that the search only
  returns a single entry, you can read the entry with the
  <literal>searchSingleEntry()</literal> methods. If you have the distinguished
  name, you can use <literal>readEntry()</literal> directly.</para>

  <para>When you get an entry object, chances are you want to handle attribute
  values as objects. The OpenDJ LDAP SDK provides the
  <literal>Entry.parseAttribute()</literal> method and an
  <literal>AttributeParser</literal> with methods for a variety of attribute
  value types. You can use these methods to get attribute values as

  <para>LDAP URLs express search requests in URL form. In the directory data
  you can find them used as <literal>memberURL</literal>
  attribute values for dynamic groups, for example. The following URL from the
  configuration for the administrative backend lets the directory server build
  a dynamic group of administrator entries that are children of
  <literal>cn=Administrators,cn=admin data</literal>.</para>

  <literallayout class="monospaced"
  >ldap:///cn=Administrators,cn=admin data??one?(objectclass=*)</literallayout>

  <para>The static method <literal>LDAPUrl.valueOf()</literal> takes an LDAP
  URL string and returns an <literal>LDAPUrl</literal> object. You can then use
  the <literal>LDAPUrl.asSearchRequest()</literal> method to get the
  <literal>SearchRequest</literal> that you pass to one of the search methods
  for the connection.</para>

  <para>If you want to sort search results in your client application, then
  make sure you have enough memory in the JVM to hold the results of the search,
  and use one of the search methods that lets you pass in a collection of
  <literal>SearchResultEntry</literal>s. After the collection is populated with
  the results, you can sort them.</para>

  <para>If you are on good terms with your directory administrator, you can
  perhaps use a server-side sort control. The server-side sort request control
  asks the server to sort the results before returning them, and so is a
  memory intensive operation on the directory server. You set up the control
  using <literal>ServerSideSortRequestControl.newControl()</literal>. You get
  the control into your search by building a search request to pass to the
  search method, using <literal>SearchRequest.addControl()</literal> to attach
  the control before passing in the request.</para>

  <para>If your application needs to scroll through search results a page at

  view indexes that facilitate scrolling through results.</para>

  You also specify the attribute type name and the value to compare to the
