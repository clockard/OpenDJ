 <title>Internationalizing Applications</title>

 <para>When you internationalize your application &#8212; adapting your
 application for use in different languages and regions &#8212; how much you
 do depends on what you must later localize. Directory servers often support
 localized user data. OpenDJ directory server supports use of the locales
 provided by your Java installation, and also supports many language subtypes,
 for example.</para>

 <para>Therefore if your application is not end user facing and the
 administrators managing your application all use the same language as you do,
 you might be content to use language subtypes in LDAP filters, as described
 in the section on <link xlink:href="dev-guide#about-filters"
 xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Working With
 Search Filters</citetitle></link>.</para>

 <para>For end user facing applications where you must return localized
 messages, TODO</para>

 <para>For applications where administrators need localized log messages,
 TODO</para>
