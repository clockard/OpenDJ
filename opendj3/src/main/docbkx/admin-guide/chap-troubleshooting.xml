 <title>Troubleshooting Server Problems</title>

 <para>This chapter describes how to troubleshoot common server problems,
 and how to collect information necessary when seeking support help.</para>
 
 <section>
  <title>Identifying the Problem</title>
  
  <para>In order to solve your problem methodically, save time by defining the
  problem clearly up front. In a replicated environment with multiple directory
  servers and many client applications, it can be particularly important to
  pin down not only the problem (difference in observed behavior compared to
  expected behavior), but also the circumstances and steps that lead to the
  problem occurring.</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
   <para>Answer the following questions.</para>
   
   <listitem>
    <para>How do you reproduce the problem?</para>
   </listitem>
   
   <listitem>
    <para>What exactly is the problem? In other words, what is the behavior
    you expected? What is the behavior you observed?</para>
   </listitem>
   
   <listitem>
    <para>When did the problem start occurring? Under similar circumstances,
    when does the problem not occur?</para>
   </listitem>
   
   <listitem>
    <para>Is the problem permanent? Intermittent? Is it getting worse?
    Getting better? Staying the same?</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>Pinpointing the problem can sometimes indicate where you should
  start looking for solutions.</para>
 </section>
 
 <section>
  <title>Troubleshooting Installation &amp; Upgrade</title>
 
  <para>Installation and upgrade procedures result in a log file tracing
  the operation. The log location differs by operating system, but look for
  lines in the command output of the following form.</para>
  
  <literallayout>See /var/....log for a detailed log of this operation.</literallayout>
 </section>
 
 <section>
  <title>Troubleshooting LDIF Import</title>
 
  <para>By default OpenDJ requires that LDIF data you import respect standards.
  In particular, OpenDJ is set to check that entries to import match the
  schema defined for the server. You can temporarily bypass this check by using
  the <option>--skipSchemaValidation</option> with the
  <command>import-ldif</command> command.</para>
  
  <para>OpenDJ also ensures by default that entries have only one inheritance
  of structural object classes. You can relax this behavior by using the
  advanced global configuration property,
  <literal>single-structural-objectclass-behavior</literal>. This can be useful
  when importing data exported from Sun Directory Server. For example, to
  warn when entries have more than one structural object class instead of
  reject such entries being added, set the property as follows.</para>
  
  <screen>$ dsconfig -p 4444 -h `hostname` -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password
 set-global-configuration-prop 
&gt; --set single-structural-objectclass-behavior:warn -X -n</screen>
  
  <para>By default, OpenDJ also checks syntax for a number of attribute types.
  You can relax this behavior as well by using the <command>dsconfig
  set-attribute-syntax-prop</command> command. See the list of attribute
  syntaxes and use the <option>--help</option> option for further
  information.</para>
  
  <para>When running <command>import-ldif</command>, you can use the <option>-R
  <replaceable>rejectFile</replaceable></option> option to capture entries that
  could not be imported, and the <option>--countRejects</option> option to
  return the number of rejected entries as the <command>import-ldif</command>
  exit code.</para>
  
  <para>Once you work through the issues with your LDIF data, reinstate the
  default behavior to ensure automated checking.</para>
 </section>
 
 <section>
  <title>Troubleshooting TLS/SSL Connections</title>
 
  <para>In order to trust the server certificate, client applications usually
  compare the signature on certificates with those of the Certificate
  Authorities (CAs) whose certificates are distributed with the client
  software. For example, the Java environment is distributed with a key store
  holding many CA certificates.</para>
  
  <screen>$ keytool -list -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit
 | wc -l
     334</screen>
  
  <para>The self-signed server certificates that can be configured during
  OpenDJ setup are not recognized as being signed by any CAs. Your software
  therefore is configured not to trust the self-signed certificates by
  default. You must either configure the client applications to accept the
  self-signed certificates, or else use certificates signed by recognized
  CAs.</para>
  
  <para>You can further debug the network traffic by collecting debug traces.
  To see the traffic going over TLS/SSL in debug mode, configure OpenDJ to dump
  debug traces from <literal>javax.net.debug</literal> into the
  <filename>logs/server.out</filename> file.</para>
  
  <screen>OPENDJ_JAVA_ARGS="-Djavax.net.debug=all" start-ds</screen>
 </section>
 
 <section>
  <title>Troubleshooting Client Operations</title>
 
  <para>By default OpenDJ logs information about all client operations in
  <filename>logs/access</filename>. The following lines are wrapped for
  readability, showing a search for the entry with
  <literal>uid=bjensen</literal> as traced in the access log. In the access
  log itself, each line starts with a time stamp.</para>
  
  <screen>[27/Jun/2011:17:23:00 +0200] CONNECT conn=19 from=127.0.0.1:56641
 to=127.0.0.1:1389 protocol=LDAP
[27/Jun/2011:17:23:00 +0200] SEARCH REQ conn=19 op=0 msgID=1
 base="dc=example,dc=com" scope=wholeSubtree filter="(uid=bjensen)" attrs="ALL"
[27/Jun/2011:17:23:00 +0200] SEARCH RES conn=19 op=0 msgID=1
 result=0 nentries=1 etime=3
[27/Jun/2011:17:23:00 +0200] UNBIND REQ conn=19 op=1 msgID=2
[27/Jun/2011:17:23:00 +0200] DISCONNECT conn=19 reason="Client Unbind"</screen>
  
  <para>As you see, each client connection and set of LDAP operations are
  traced, starting with a time stamp and information about the operation
  performed, then including information about the connection, the operation
  number for the sequence of operations performed by the client, a message
  identification number, and additional information about the operation.</para>
  
  <para>Do help diagnose errors due to access permissions, OpenDJ supports the
  get effective rights control. The control OID,
  <literal>1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.9.5.2</literal>, is not allowed by the default
  global ACIs. You must therefore add access to use the get effective rights
  control when not using it as Directory Manager.</para>
 </section>
 
 <section>
  <title>Troubleshooting Replication</title>
  
  <para>Replication can generally recover from conflicts and transient issues.
  Replication does, however, require that update operations be copied
  from server to server. It is therefore possible to experience temporary
  delays while replicas converge, especially when the write operation load is
  heavy. OpenDJ's tolerance for temporary divergence between replicas is what
  allows OpenDJ to remain available to serve client applications even when
  networks linking the replicas go down.</para>
  
  <para>In other words, the fact that directory services are loosely convergent
  rather than transactional is a feature, not a bug.</para>
  
  <para>That said, you may encounter errors. Replication uses its own error log
  file, <filename>logs/replication</filename>. Error messages in the log file
  have <literal>category=SYNC</literal>. The messages have the following form.
  Here the line is folded for readability.</para>
  
  <screen>[27/Jun/2011:14:37:48 +0200] category=SYNC severity=INFORMATION msgID=14680169
 msg=Replication server accepted a connection from 10.10.0.10/10.10.0.10:52859
 to local address 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:8989 but the SSL handshake failed. This is
 probably benign, but may indicate a transient network outage or a
 misconfigured client application connecting to this replication server.
 The error was: Remote host closed connection during handshake</screen>
 
  <para>Replicas can become irrevocably out of sync if for example you restore
  a replica from backup with a backup archive older than the last time
  historical information for replication was purged from the system. If this
  happens to you, disable the replica, and then reinitialize it with newer
  data.</para>
 </section>
 
 <section>
  <title>Asking For Help</title>
  
  <para>When you cannot resolve a problem yourself, and want to ask for help,
  clearly identify the problem and how you reproduce it, and also the version
  of OpenDJ you use to reproduce the problem. The version includes both a
  version number and also a build time stamp.</para>
  
  <screen>$ dsconfig --version
OpenDJ <?eval ${project.version}?>
Build <replaceable>yyyymmddhhmmss</replaceable>Z</screen>
  
  <itemizedlist>
  
   <para>Be ready to provide additional information, too.</para>
   
   <listitem>
    <para>The output from the <command>java -version</command> command.</para>
   </listitem>
   
   <listitem>
    <para><filename>access</filename> and <filename>errors</filename> logs
    showing what the server was doing when the problem started occurring</para>
   </listitem>
   
   <listitem>
    <para>A copy of the server configuration file,
    <filename>config/config.ldif</filename>, in use when the problem started
    occurring</para>
   </listitem>
   
   <listitem>
    <para>Other relevant logs or output, such as those from client applications
    experiencing the problem</para>
   </listitem>
   
   <listitem>
    <para>A description of the environment where OpenDJ is running, including
    system characteristics, host names, IP addresses, Java versions, storage
    characteristics, and network characteristics. This helps to understand
    the logs, and other information.</para>
   </listitem>
