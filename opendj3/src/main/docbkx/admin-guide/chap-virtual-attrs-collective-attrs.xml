 <title>Working With Virtual and Collective Attributes</title>

 <para>OpenDJ supports virtual attributes with dynamically generated values.
 Virtual attributes are used by the server. You can also define your own.
 OpenDJ also supports standard collective attributes as described in
 <link xlink:href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3671'>RFC 3671</link>,
 allowing entries to share common, read-only attribute values.</para>

 <para>This chapter demonstrates how to define virtual and collective
 attributes, showing common solutions as examples of their use.</para>

  <title>Collective Attributes</title>
  
  <para>Collective attributes provide a standard mechanism for defining
  attributes that appear on all the entries in a subtree potentially filtered
  by object class. Standard collective attribute type names have the prefix
  <literal>c-</literal>.</para>
     
  <para>OpenDJ extends collective attributes to make them easier to use.
  You can define any OpenDJ attribute as collective using the
  <literal>;collective</literal> attribute option. You can use LDAP filters
  in your subtree specification for fine-grained control over which entries
  have the collective attributes.</para>

  <para>For example, you can define administrative privileges that
  apply to all users who belong to an administrators group. Alternatively
  you can define attributes that specify services available for a user
  depending on that user's service level.</para>
