 <title>Preface</title>

 <para>This guide shows you how to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot
 OpenDJ directory services. This guide also describes file layouts, ports
 used, and standards, controls, extended operations, and languages supported
 for OpenDJ installations.</para>

 <section>
  <title>Who Should Read this Guide</title>

  <para>This guide is written for directory designers and administrators who
  build, deploy, and maintain OpenDJ directory services for your
  organizations.</para>

  <para>This guide starts by introducing the OpenDJ administrative interfaces
  and tools, and by showing how to manage OpenDJ server processes. It also
  demonstrates how to import and export directory data. This guide continues
  by showing how to configure and monitor the principle features of individual
  OpenDJ servers, and how to configure and monitor replicated server
  topologies for distributed high availability. It then demonstrates how to
  tune, troubleshoot, and move servers. This guide concludes with appendices
  of useful reference information for directory designers and
  administrators.</para>

  <para>You do not need to be an LDAP wizard to learn something from this
  guide, though a background in directory services and maintaining server
  software can help. You do need some background in managing servers and
  services on your operating system of choice. You can nevertheless get
  started with this guide, and then learn more as you go along.</para>

  <title>Formatting Conventions</title>

  <note><para>Pay attention to notes like this one.</para></note>

  <para>Some items might be formatted differently from other text, like
  <filename>filenames</filename>, <command>commands</command>, and
  <literal>literal values</literal>.</para>

  <screen>$ echo Terminal sessions are formatted like this.
Terminal sessions are formatted like this.</screen>

  <programlisting language='java'>class Test
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        System.out.println("This is a program listing.");
    }
}</programlisting>

  <para>In many cases, sections pertaining to UNIX, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, BSD,
  and so forth are marked (UNIX). Sections pertaining to Microsoft Windows
  might be marked (Windows). To avoid repetition, however, file system
  directory names are often given only in UNIX format as in
  <filename>/path/to/OpenDJ</filename>, even if the text applies to
  <filename>C:\path\to\OpenDJ</filename> as well.</para>

  <title>Accessing OpenDJ Documentation Online</title>

  <para>Core documentation, such as what you are now reading, aims to
  be technically accurate and complete with respect to the software
  documented. Core documentation therefore follows a <link
  xlink:href='https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/devcom/Review+Process'
  >three-phase review process</link> designed to eliminate errors. The
  review process should slow authors down enough that documentation you get
  with a stable release has had time to bake fully.</para>

  <!-- TODO: online location of core documentation, perhaps docs.forgerock.org? -->
  <para>Fully baked core documentation is available at <link
  xlink:href='http://...'>...</link>.</para>

  <para>You need not wait until the core documentation is finished, though,
  to read more about OpenDJ, and also to read about related topics that
  involve OpenDJ without being strictly about OpenDJ. The <link
  xlink:href='https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/OPENDJ'
  >OpenDJ Wiki</link> regularly brings you more, fresh content. In addition,
  you are welcome to <link
  xlink:href='https://idp.forgerock.org/openam/UI/Login?service=register'
  >sign up</link> and then edit the Wiki if you notice an error, or if you
  have something to share.</para>

  <title>Joining the OpenDJ Community</title>

  <para>After you <link
  xlink:href='https://idp.forgerock.org/openam/UI/Login?service=register'
  >sign up</link> at ForgeRock, you can also login to the Wiki and the issue
  database to follow what is happening with the project.</para>

  <para>If you have questions regarding OpenDJ which are not answered by the
  documentation, there is a mailing list which can be found at
  <link xlink:href='https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/opendj'
  >https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/opendj</link> where you are
  likely to find an answer.</para>

  <para>You can join the IRC discussion in the #opendj room at
  irc.freenode.net.</para>

  <para>The Wiki has information on how to check out OpenDJ source code.
  There is also a mailing list for OpenDJ development which can be found at
  <link xlink:href='https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/opendj-dev'
  >https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/opendj-dev</link>
  Should you want to contribute a patch, test, or feature, or want to author
  part of the core documentation, first have a look on the ForgeRock Community
