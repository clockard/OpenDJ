 <title>Configuring Privileges &amp; Access Control</title>

 <para>OpenDJ supports use of both access control instructions and privileges.
 Access control instructions can be added to directory data for fine-grained
 control over what a given user or group member is authorized to do.
 Privileges are implemented independently from access control. By default,
 privileges restrict administrative access to directory root users. You can
 configure OpenDJ to extend privileges to other administrators as well.</para>
 
 <para>This chapter covers both access control instructions and privileges,
 demonstrating how to configure both.</para>
