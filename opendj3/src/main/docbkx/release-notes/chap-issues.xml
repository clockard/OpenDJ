  <title>Limitations</title>

  <para>Release <?eval ${docTargetVersion}?> has the following limitations,
  none of which are new since <?eval ${stableServerVersion}?>.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>OpenDJ directory server provides full LDAP v3 support, except for
    alias dereferencing, and limited support for LDAPv2.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>When you configure account lockout as part of password policy,
    OpenDJ locks an account after the specified number of consecutive
    authentication failures. Account lockout is not transactional across a
    replication topology, however. Global account lockout occurs as soon as
    the authentication failure times have been replicated.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>OpenDJ is not fully integrated with Microsoft Windows, yet OpenDJ
    directory server can be run as a service, and thus displayed in the
    Windows Services Control Panel.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>OpenDJ replication is designed to permit an unlimited number
    of replication servers in your topology. Project testing has, however,
    focused only on topologies of up to eight replication servers.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>On Niagara systems such as T2000, hardware SSL crypto acceleration
    runs more slowly than software crypto acceleration. To work around this
    issue take the following actions.</para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>Add more request handlers to LDAP (for TLS) and LDAPS (for SSL)
      connection handlers.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Disable hardware acceleration for server's JVM by removing the
      SunPKCS11 security provider from
      <filename>jre/lib/security/java.security</filename>.</para>
