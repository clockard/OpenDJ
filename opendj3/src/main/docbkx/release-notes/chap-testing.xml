 <title>Tested Operating Systems &amp; Application Servers</title>
 
 <para>OpenDJ software depends on the Java environment more than it depends
 on the underlying operating systems. OpenDJ directory server relies on Java 6,
 specifically at least the Java Standard Edition 6.0 (Sun version 1.6.0_10)
 runtime environment. For best server performance, use at least version
 1.6.0_22, which includes a major security fix for TLS as well. To build
 applications with the OpenDJ LDAP SDK, you need the Java SDK as the runtime
 environment has no compiler.</para>

 <para>That said, OpenDJ <?eval ${docTargetVersion}?> has been validated on
 the following operating systems.</para>
