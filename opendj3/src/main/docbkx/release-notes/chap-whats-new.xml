  <title>What's New in OpenDJ <?eval ${docTargetVersion}?></title>

  <para>Compared to the OpenDJ <?eval ${stableServerVersion} ?>, OpenDJ
  <?eval ${docTargetVersion}?> fixes a number of issues, and provides the
  following additional features.</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>TODO</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>OpenDJ now lets you delegate authentication to another LDAP
      directory service, such as Active Directory. The feature is called
      <firstterm>pass through authentication</firstterm> (PTA) (OPENDJ-262).
      With PTA, OpenDJ replays a user's simple bind operation against the remote
      directory service. If the bind is successful, OpenDJ considers the user
      authenticated to perform subsequent operations like searches and updates
      in OpenDJ.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
       <para>For PTA to work, OpenDJ must be able to match its OpenDJ entry for
       the user with the user's entry on the remote directory service. The two
       entries must correspond in one of the following ways.</para>
       <listitem>
        <para>Both the OpenDJ entry and the remote entry have the same DN.</para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>The OpenDJ entry has an attribute that holds the DN of the entry
        on the remote directory service.</para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>The OpenDJ entry and the remote entry share an attribute that
        has exactly the same value.</para>
       </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>If user entries do not match originally, you can no doubt add an
      attribute to users' OpenDJ entries when configuring them to use pass
      through authentication.</para>
      <!-- TODO: Add an olink when we have support for such things. -->
      <para>To configure PTA, you set up an LDAP pass through authentication
      policy in OpenDJ's configuration, and then assign the policy to users in
      the same way you would assign a password policy. See the
      <citetitle>Administration Guide</citetitle> for details.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>OpenDJ can now synchronize Samba password attribute values with the
     <literal>userPassword</literal> attribute value, ensuring that when users
     change their LDAP passwords in OpenDJ or change their LanMan or NT
     passwords in Samba, their password attribute values all stay in sync
     (OPENDJ-233). To activate this feature, configure the OpenDJ Samba
     Password plugin by using the <command>dsconfig</command> command.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Collective attributes can now be applied based on the values of
      virtual attributes (OPENDJ-76).</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>OpenDJ now generates <literal>modifiersName</literal> and
      <literal>modifyTimestamp</literal> for add operations (OPENDJ-84).</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>OpenDJ now permits backup of administrative backend types
      such as LDIF and trust stores (OPENDJ-89).</para>
    </listitem>
