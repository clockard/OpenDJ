TODO list

* reference attribute mapper
* finish attribute filters: pass in JSON pointers to toJSON method
* resolve issues regarding read/query routing. Distinction currently based on
  presence of query params which is wrong since reads may contain params as
  well.
* server side sorting, query filters, paged results
* query should return entire resources, not ids only
* implement create/delete/put/patch/action.
* bulk support?
* convert mappers to builders
* authentication

* gateway (file based config, Grizzly IO, WAR packaging)
* standalone embedded listener (server config framework, internal connections, OpenDJ extension)
* container embedded listener (as above, OpenDJ packaged as WAR).
