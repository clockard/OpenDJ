 <title>Working With Groups of Entries</title>

 <para>OpenDJ supports several methods of grouping entries in the directory.
 Static groups list their members, whereas dynamic groups look up their
 membership based on an LDAP filter. OpenDJ also supports virtual static
 groups, which uses a dynamic group style definition, but allows applications
 to work with the group as if it were static. OpenDJ can also mimic
 the behavior of non-standard roles as implemented in Oracle DSEE.</para>

 <para>When listing entries in static groups, you must also have a mechanism
 for removing entries from the list when they are deleted or modified in ways
 that end their membership. OpenDJ makes that possible with
 <emphasis>referential integrity</emphasis> functionality.</para>
 
 <para>This chapter demonstrates how to work with groups.</para>
