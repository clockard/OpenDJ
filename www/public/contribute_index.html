<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> There are a number of ways that you can get involved with the OpenDS project, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Participate in the mailing lists and/or discussion forums.</li>
  <li>Use the issue tracker to file bugs, enhancement requests, feature ideas, etc.</li>
  <li>Help us review our documentation and keep it up to date.</li>
  <li>Contribute bugfixes or help us to write new code.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <A HREF="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/docs/dev-docs/OpenDS-Governance.html">OpenDS Governance Model</a> for more information about the ways in which individuals may participate in the project.</p>
<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
<p>There are several mailing lists in use for this project. Most of them are open to anyone that wants to subscribe, although some of them may be restricted to specific subsets of users. See the <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Project Mailing Lists</a> page to see a complete list and for information about subscribing. Note that you can subscribe to mailing lists in digest mode to keep the number of messages down.</p>
<p>Some of the mailing lists that we provide are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="mailto:announce@opends.dev.java.net">announce@opends.dev.java.net</a> -- A low-volume list that you can use to find out about new releases or other significant developments in the project.</li>
  <li><a href="mailto:users@opends.dev.java.net">users@opends.dev.java.net</a> -- Used for general discussion about the OpenDS project, including asking questions and providing comments or feedback.</li>
  <li><a href="mailto:dev@opends.dev.java.net">dev@opends.dev.java.net</a> -- Used for discussions among developers on topics related to the OpenDS source code.</li>
  <li><a href="mailto:contribution-request@opends.dev.java.net">contribution-request@opends.dev.java.net</a> -- Used to request the Contributor role in the OpenDS project, which is required for anyone that wants to contribute changes to the code or documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Issue Tracker</h3>
<p>The OpenDS issue tracker is available online at <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">https://opends.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues</a>. You can use it to submit new bug reports or feature requests for the OpenDS server, or to browse the list of issues that have already been filed. Anyone can query the issue tracker, although it will be necessary to have at least the Observer role in the project to file new requests. </p>
<p>Note that we have imported our feature request list for this project into the issue tracking system so that we can keep track of them and make sure that they are included in the appropriate release. If you're interested in what we have planned for the server, then the issue tracker is a good place to find out.</p>
<h3>Contributing Documentation or Code</h3>

<p>If you want to participate in the project by reviewing or updating the documentation or by making code changes, then you will first need to complete and submit the Sun Contributor Agreement as outlined in the <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/docs/dev-docs/OpenDS-Governance.html#sca_policy">OpenDS Governance Model</a>.  Once this agreement has been accepted, you can forward the confirmation to <a href="mailto:contribution-request@opends.dev.java.net">contribution-request@opends.dev.java.net</a> to request the Contributor role.  An OpenDS committer will be assigned to work with you.  Individuals who have been given the Contributor role will not initially be allowed to commit changes directly into the repository, but active Contributors may be granted the Committer role over time.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/docs/dev-docs/OpenDS-Governance.html">OpenDS Governance Model</a> for more details about the roles that individuals may have in the OpenDS project.</p>
