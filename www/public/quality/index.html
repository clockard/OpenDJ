<h3><a name="overview" id="overview"></a>Overview</h3>
<p> Among other things, the OpenDS project quality process involves :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thorough code reviews by peer and fellow <a href="../community_index.html">community</a> members </li>
  <li>Maximizing <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">code coverage</a> through unit tests and carefully wrapped integration tests</li>
  <li>Continuous build and integration with <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">Hudson</a></li>
  <li>Advanced user oriented test with <a href="http://staf.sourceforge.net/index.php" target="_blank">Staf/Stax</a></li>
  <li>Robustness testing with tools like <a href="http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c06/ldapv3/" target="_blank">OULU</a> </li>
  <li>Protocol compliance testing with independent third-party tools like the <a href="http://opengroup.org/" target="_blank">OpenGroup</a>  <a href="http://opengroup.org/testing/testsuites/vsldap.htm" target="_blank">VSLDAP suite</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>The quality in the OpenDS project is not the result of a distinct team of &quot;Quality Assurance&quot; experts but it is the responsibilty of each individual contributor.</p>
<h3><a name="contribute" id="contribute"></a>Contributing Tests </h3>
<p>If you want to participate in the project by adding tests or fixing broken or deprecated tests, then you will first need to complete and submit the Sun Contributor Agreement as outlined in the <a href="../docs/dev-docs/OpenDS-Governance.html#sca_policy">OpenDS Governance Model</a>.  Once this agreement has been accepted, you can forward the confirmation to <a href="mailto:contribution-request@opends.dev.java.net">contribution-request@opends.dev.java.net</a> to request the Contributor role.  An OpenDS committer will be assigned to work with you.  Individuals who have been given the Contributor role will not initially be allowed to commit changes directly into the repository, but active Contributors may be granted the Committer role over time.</p>
<h3><a name="unit" id="unit"></a>Unit Tests </h3>
<p>Unit testing consist of testing the basic units of a given piece of software. Each test must be a single and as specific as possible question. There are many different types of unit tests:</p>
<ol>
  <li>tests that define  what must work</li>
  <li>tests that define what must not happen</li>
  <li>tests that define consistence between symmetrical (or reciprocal) methods   </li>
</ol>
<p>The unit tests are available in the OpenDS repository in <em>{/path/to/workspace}/opends//tests/unit-tests-testng</em>. The repository contains all the libraries you need to build and run the tests. To run the unit tests, use the test target in the main build.xml file.</p>
<p>To do so, change to <em>{/path/to/workspace}/opends</em> and :</p>
<ul>
  <li>on Unix, run: <em>./build.sh test</em></li>
  <li>on Windows, run: <em>build.bat test</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The build also comes with a very useful tool to drive your test writing: code coverage. Once you've written your set of tests and run them successfully, you may want to know how good those tests actually are in covering your code. Just use the <em>testwithcoverage</em> target. </p>
<p>To do so, change to <em>{/path/to/workspace}/opends</em> and :</p>
<ul>
  <li>on Unix, run: <em>./build.sh testwithcoverage</em></li>
  <li>on Windows, run: <em>build.bat testwithcoverage</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the build, the code coverage tool will provide you with an html report that you will find in {/path/to/workspace}/opends/build/coverage/report/index.html. Use it to figure out what methods you've missed in your testing and improve your test suite. </p>
<h3><a name="integration" id="integration"></a>Integration Tests</h3>
<p> Integration testing aims at checking that the interfaces to the outside world allow easy and smooth integration of the test object (i.e. the product) in an existing system. </p>
<p>You can find this suite in <em>{/path/to/workspace}/opends/tests/integration-tests-testng</em>.</p>
<p>On Unix and Linux, simply change to {/path/to/workspace}/opends/tests/integration-tests-testng and run <em>build.sh</em>. This will build the tests and generate another script <em>test.sh</em> that you will have to execute to actually run the tests. </p>
<p>We are in the process of moving away from the shell scripts and porting everything to ant to be as platform independent as possible.</p>
<h3><a name="functional" id="functional"></a>Functional Tests</h3>
<p>System functional testing is a form of software testing that attempts to   determine whether each function of the system works as specified.</p>
<p>This is not available in the repository as of today but we are working on a prototype that would let us test the features in more complex deployment schemes than the other suites currently permit.</p>
