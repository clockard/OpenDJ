The first thing to know is that the synchronization feature of Open DS
is still a work in progress.<br>
As such the code does not always match what is described in the
Synchronization architecture document. <br>
it is also important to understand that this code is not fully
completed and not fully unit tested.<br>
<h3>Design goals</h3>
Each OpenDS module should have as little dependencies on each other,
therefore the Synchronization code should 100% stay in the
sycnhronization plugin. It should be able to work on any type of
backend. For example it should be able to synchronize information in
the cn=config backend or cn=schema backend.<br>
<h3>Features currently available</h3>
LDAP server publisher code is available.<br>
LDAP server receiver code is available.<br>
Changelog service is available.<br>
These three parts allow to replicate all types of operations reliably
and with good performances.<br>
Changelog service save the changes to stable storage.<br>
Conflict resolution on modify operation is partially implemented.<br>
Some Synchronous service is prototyped but needs a lot of rework.<br>
<h3>Features to be done</h3>
Some security (authentication and crypto) needs to be added to the
synchronization protocol. As of now any application can connect to the
changelog service and submit and receive changes without any
credentials.<br>
Configuration of the synchronization needs to be finalized.<br>
Dependencies of the operations needs to be implemented.<br>
Naming conflict resolution must be implemented.<br>
Should have a way to export/import changelog databases.<br>
Synchronization messages encoding should add a version number for
compatibility with further releases.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

<h3>Structure of packages</h3>
Below the <span style="font-family: monospace;">org.opends.server</span>
package two subpackages are used :<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">changelog</span> package
holds all the code that runs on the changelog server side.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">synchronization</span>
package holds all the code that runs on the directory server side.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Main classes of the synchronization package</h3>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">MultimasterSynchronization</span>
contains the synchronization provider code and more generally all the
code that makes the glue between the core server and the
synchronization code<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">SynchronizationDomain</span>
contains the bulk of the Directory Server side of the synchronization
code. Most notably it contains the root method for publishing a change,
processing a change received from the changelog service, handle
conflict resolution, handle protocol messages from the changelog server.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">ChangeNumber</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">ChangeNumberGenerator</span> contain
the code related to Change Numbers code and their generation.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">ServerState</span> contain
the code necessary for maintaining the updatedness of a server.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">Historical</span> and the
classes that it uses contain the code for generating and loading the
historical information (only modify aspects are implemented)<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">SynchronizationMessage</span>
and the classes that inherit from it contain the description of the
protocol messages that are exchanged between the directory servers and
the changelog servers and their encoding/decoding.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Main classes of the changelog package</h3>
<ul>
  <li>SocketSession implements the ProtocolSession interface that is
used by the changelog server and the directory server to communicate.
This is done by using the innate encoding/decoding capabilities of the
SynchronizationMessages objects. This class is used by both the
changelog and the synchronization package.</li>
  <li>ChangelogCache implements the multiplexing part of the changelog
server. It contains method for forwarding all the received messages to
the ServerHandler and to the dbHandler objects.<br>
  </li>
  <li>ServerHandler contains the code related to handler of remote
server. It can manage changelog servers of directory servers (may be it
shoudl be splitted in two different classes, one for each of these).<br>
  </li>
  <li>ServerWriter the thread responsible for writing to the remote
server.<br>
  </li>
  <li>ServerReader the thread responsible for reading from the remote
object.<br>
  </li>
  <li>DbHandler contains the code responsible for saving the changes to
stable storage.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Unit tests</h3>
A few tests have been written and stay in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">tests/unit-tests-testng/src/server</span>,
package <span style="font-family: monospace;">org.opends.server.synchronization</span><br>
Currently tests are availables for SynchronizationMessage
encoding/decoding and for modify conflict resolution code.<br>
More tests should be developped shortly.<br>
