    <br>
    There are a number of individuals already contributing to the development
    of OpenDS, and each one has their own coding style.  In general, we want to
    allow that so that developers can be comfortable and therefore as
    productive as possible.  However, there do need to be a number of
    guidelines and requirements in place to make it easier for everyone to be
    able to work together and particularly to avoid the need for commits to
    include large amounts of reformatting simply because one developer's IDE
    uses different settings than another's.

    <br><br>
    <b>General Server Source Requirements Enforced by Checkstyle</b>
    <br><br>
    All source code that is part of the OpenDS server and related components
    (i.e., that code which is located below the "<code>src</code>" directory)
    will be required to pass the following tests:
    <ul>
      <li>
        All source files must begin with the following header:
        <blockquote><pre>/*
 * CDDL HEADER START
 *
 * The contents of this file are subject to the terms of the
 * Common Development and Distribution License, Version 1.0 only
 * (the "License").  You may not use this file except in compliance
 * with the License.
 *
 * You can obtain a copy of the license at
 * trunk/opends/resource/legal-notices/OpenDS.LICENSE
 * or https://OpenDS.dev.java.net/OpenDS.LICENSE.
 * See the License for the specific language governing permissions
 * and limitations under the License.
 *
 * When distributing Covered Code, include this CDDL HEADER in each
 * file and include the License file at
 * trunk/opends/resource/legal-notices/OpenDS.LICENSE.  If applicable,
 * add the following below this CDDL HEADER, with the fields enclosed
 * by brackets "[]" replaced with your own identifying * information:
 *      Portions Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]
 *
 * CDDL HEADER END</pre>
        </blockquote>
        For any code that has been developed at least in part by Sun
        employees, this header must also include (below the "<code>CDDL HEADER
        END</code>" line) a line containing the text (with an updated year as
        appropriate):
        <blockquote><pre> *      Portions Copyright 2007 Sun Microsystems, Inc.</pre></blockquote>
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>All classes and interfaces must have class-level Javadoc
          headers, regardless of their visibility.<br><br></li>
      <li>All non-private methods must have Javadoc headers including a general
          description of the method, descriptions for all method parameters,
          a description of the return value, and descriptions for all declared
          exceptions (including runtime exceptions).  Although checkstyle does
          not enforce this requirement for private methods in the general case,
          it is strongly encouraged that they be documented in this way as
          well.<br><br></li>
      <li>All public and protected fields must have Javadoc headers that
          describe the purpose of that field.<br><br></li>
      <li>All Javadoc headers must have a period at the end of their first
          sentence.  Javadoc headers will not be allowed to be empty.  Any HTML
          used in the headers must be well-formed.<br><br></li>
      <li>No line may exceed 80 characters in length.<br><br></li>
      <li>No tab characters may be used to indent the source code.<br><br></li>
      <li>No lines will be allowed to contain trailing whitespace.<br><br></li>
      <li>Strings equality determinations must be performed using
          "<code>String.equals(Object)</code>" and must not use
          "<code>==</code>".<br><br></li>
      <li>Any class that implements an "<code>equals(Object)</code>" method
          must also implement a "<code>hashCode()</code>" method.<br><br></li>
      <li>All classes must contain a <code>package</code>
          declaration.<br><br></li>
      <li>Switch statements will not be allowed to have non-empty cases that
          fall-through to subsequent cases.<br><br></li>
      <li>Any literal <code>long</code> values which appear in the code must be
          followed by an uppercase "<code>L</code>" character rather than by a
          lowercase "<code>l</code>" in order to make it easier to distinguish
          it from the digit "<code>1</code>".<br><br></li>
      <li>Classes must not contain any unused or redundant imports.  They also
          must not import any classes in the "<code>sun.*</code>" package
          structure.<br><br></li>
      <li>Empty statements (i.e., those containing only a semicolon) will not
          be allowed.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    <b>"Documentation Target" Server Source Requirements Enforced by
       Checkstyle</b>
    <br><br>
    Any source code which is considered a likely candidate for being included
    in documentation must meet all of the general sever source requirements as
    listed above, but will also be subject to the additional requirements
    listed below.  Source code that is considered a documentation target
    includes all code in the <code>org.opends.server.api</code>,
    <code>org.opends.server.protocols.internal</code>, and
    <code>org.opends.server.types</code> packages and their descendants.  The
    additional constraints that will be enforced for these classes include:
    <ul>
      <li>All methods, including private methods, must have full Javadoc
          headers (i.e., private methods are not exempt from the Javadoc
          requirement in these classes).<br><br></li>
      <li>No line may exceed 70 characters in length.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    <b>Unit Test Source Requirements Enforced by Checkstyle</b>
    <br><br>
    In general, unit tests are exempt from most of the checkstyle requirements
    enforced for the server source code, although it is still strongly
    recommended that developers follow good development practices when writing
    such code.  However, only the following requirements will be enforced by
    Checkstyle:
    <ul>
      <li>All unit test source classes must begin with the same CDDL header
          described above for general source code.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    <b>General Source Requirements and Guidelines Not Enforced by
       Checkstyle</b>
    <br><br>
    OpenDS developers should keep all of the following in mind when writing
    code, although there are currently no checks implemented to enforce this
    behavior:
    <ul>
      <li>Source code should be formatted using two-space indents.<br><br></li>
      <li>Source files must end with an end-of-line character.  Some IDEs have
          a tendency to not automatically include an end-of-line sequence
          (e.g., the last byte of the file is the closing brace at the end of
          the class).  This can cause problems in some cases, particularly
          when attempting to use standard text-processing tools like the UNIX
          <code>sed</code> command on those files.<br><br></li>
      <li>All comments must include proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
          Only American English may be used.  No profanity or offensive or
          derisive content will be allowed.<br><br></li>
      <li>The use of string literals should be carefully monitored to ensure
          that all messages may be internationalized/localized.<br><br></li>
      <li>Any code that is not completely implemented, or that is implemented
          in a sub-optimal manner that needs to be re-written must be marked
          with special identifiers that can be used to help find that code
          later.  Any code that is not completely implemented must include a
          comment with the string "<code>NYI</code>" (for "not yet
          implemented") or "<code>TODO</code>".  Any code that needs to be
          re-implemented must be marked with a comment containing the string
          "<code>FIXME</code>".
      <li>When overriding a method defined in a superclass, the
          "<code>{@inheritDoc}</code>" Javadoc statement may be used instead of
          repeating the Javadoc header from the superclass, unless there is a
          need for the content of that header to be different.  This tag must
          not be used when overriding a method that is not defined in the
          OpenDS codebase.<br><br></li>
      <li>The "<code>@author</code>" Javadoc tag should not be used, as it is
          difficult to maintain over time and this information is already
          recorded in the source repository.<br><br></li>
      <li>All source filenames, class names, method names, and field names
          should be sufficiently descriptive so that it is relatively easy to
          understand their purpose.  All non-trivial variables used within
          methods should also follow this convention.<br><br></li>
      <li>Class names should start with a capital letter and should use
          camel-casing to capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.
          Method, non-final field, and variable names should start with a
          lowercase letter and use camel-casing to capitalize the first letter
          of each subsequent word.  Constant fields should be named with all
          capital letters, and should use underscores to separate individual
          words.<br><br</li>
      <li>The use of inner classes should be avoided, as it can make it more
          difficult to map the class name to a corresponding source file.  In
          general, each class should be implemented in a separate source file
          for ease of use by other developers and to help keep the code layout
          more simple.<br><br></li>
      <li>If you are defining custom schema elements, controls, extended
          operations, or anything else which requires an OID, you must request
          that OID from Neil.  Do not simply take what appears to be the next
          available OID.  Do not commit schema elements without a valid numeric
          OID.<br><br></li>
      <li>Virtually all constructors (other than those contained in the
          logging code and perhaps a few other critical exceptions) for classes
          that are part of the server should include a
          <code>debugConstructor</code> call at the beginning of the
          constructor, protected by an <code>assert</code> statement so that it
          has no impact when the JVM is run with assertions
          disabled.<br><br></li>
      <li>Virtually all methods (other than those contained in the logging code
          and perhaps a few other critical exceptions) for classes that are
          part of the server should include a <code>debugEnter</code> call at
          the beginning of the method, protected by an <code>assert</code>
          statement so that it has no impact when the JVM is run with
          assertions disabled.<br><br></li>
      <li>Virtually all <code>catch</code> blocks (other than those contained
          in the logging code and perhaps a few other cases) for classes that
          are part of the server should include a <code>debugException</code>
          call at the beginning of the <code>catch</code> block, protected by
          an <code>assert</code> statement so that it has no impact when the
          JVM is run with assertions disabled.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    <b>OpenDS Commit Requirements</b>
    <br><br>
    The following requirements and guidelines should be met when committing
    any changes to the OpenDS source repository:
    <ul>
      <li>The server must build cleanly with no warnings or errors of any kind
          (including warnings generated by the Java and Javadoc compilers) when
          built using the <code>precommit</code> target.<br><br></li>
      <li>When committing code, commit messages must have a clear description
          of the associated change so that someone who is only looking at the
          "<code>svn log</code>" output can have a basic understanding of the
          purpose of that commit.  Commit messages must not be
          empty.<br><br></li>
      <li>Commit messages must use proper spelling, punctuation, and grammar.
          Only American English will be allowed.<br><br></li>
      <li>In all but the most trivial cases, commits should be associated with
          an issue in the issue tracker.  The commit message must include the
          corresponding issue number, and the issue tracker must be updated
          with the revision number of the commit(s) associated with that
          issue.  Note, however, that it is not acceptable for commit messages
          to only reference an issue number (e.g., "Fix for issue 1234")
          because that fails the requirement of being able to understand the
          purpose of that change when looking only at the commit
          log.<br><br></li>
      <li>Whenever possible, code changes should be accompanied by unit tests
          that cover the corresponding code.<br><br></li>
      <li>Trivial commits (sometimes called "one-line commits", although this
          may cover changes impacting more than just one line) generally do not
          require any review (unless the source tree is frozen or we are in a
          critical stage of development in which changes should be restricted).
          However, developers are certainly free to request reviews for any
          code changes.<br><br></li>
      <li>Small code changes that are not overly complex but nevertheless do
          not qualify as a "trivial commit" should at least be sent out for
          review to the
          "<a href="mailto:opends-precommit-ext@sun.com">opends-precommit-ext@sun.com</a>
          mailing list for other developers to see and/or comment on.  However,
          if there are no comments after a sufficient period of time has passed
          (which should allow at least a reasonable period of time for
          developers both in the United States and Europe to see the changes
          and have a chance to comment on them), then the changes may be
          committed without further requests for review.<br><br></li>
      <li>Large and/or complex code changes must be available for public review
          and should be approved by at least one person.<br><br></li>
      <li>Any code change which may have a potential impact on standards
          compliance, protocol encoding/decoding, etc. must be reviewed and
          approved before committing.<br><br></li>
      <li>For any change that is reviewed and approved by one or more
          individuals, the name(s) of the reviewer(s) must be included in the
          issue tracker.  They may also appear in the commit
          message.<br><br></li>
    </ul>
