    <br>
    As mentioned earlier, the OpenDS source code is stored in a Subversion
    repository hosted on java.net.  Subversion is a version control system that
    is similar to (but meant to be better than) CVS.  For more details about
    Subversion, see the website at
    <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>,
    where you will find a fairly comprehensive
    <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html">FAQ</a> as well as a
    pointer to a <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">book</a> with detailed
    information about how to use it.

    <br><br>
    <b>Subversion Clients</b>
    <br><br>
    In order to check out the code from the repository, you will first need a
    Subversion client.  There are subversion clients available for virtually
    every platform you might want to use, in various flavors, including:

    <ul>
      <li>
        The <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">Subversion packages</a>
        page on the main Subversion site includes information about how to get
        clients for many different platforms, including Solaris, Linux, BSD, 
        Windows, and Mac OS X.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        On Solaris, the command-line Subversion client is also available
        through <a href="http://www.blastwave.org/">Blastwave.org</a>.  The GUI
        RapidSVN client is also available for Solaris through Blastwave.org.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        On Windows, <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a>
        provides integration with the Windows explorer shell.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Recent versions of many Java IDEs include Subversion support,
        including <a href="http://subversion.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>,
        <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Eclipse</a>,
        <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/version_control.html#Subversion">IDEA</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.omnicore.com/en/xdevelop_features.htm">X-Develop</a>.
        <br><br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <b>Setting Up Proxy Support</b>
    <br><br>
    If you need to go through a proxy server in order to access the Internet,
    then you will need to configure the Subversion client to do so as well.
    With most Subversion clients, this can be done by editing the Subversion
    "<code>servers</code>" configuration file.  On UNIX-based systems, the path
    to this file will generally be "<code>~/.subversion/servers</code>", and
    on Windows systems it will be "<code>%APPDATA%\Subversion\servers</code>".
    Open this file with a text editor and make the following changes:

    <ul>
      <li>
        In the "<code>[groups]</code>" section, add a line that looks like:
       <blockquote><code>javadotnet = *.java.net</code></blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a new section below the "<code>[groups]</code>" section with the
        following contents:
        <blockquote>   
          <code>[javadotnet]</code><br>
          <code>http-proxy-host = proxy.example.com</code><br>
          <code>http-proxy-port = 8080</code><br>
        </blockquote>   
      </li>
    </ul>

    Obviously you should substitute the correct address and port for your proxy
    server.  If you need additional configuration (e.g., your proxy server
    requires authentication), then comments in the "<code>servers</code>" file
    should provide enough information to get things set up properly.

    <br><br>
    <b>Configuring Correct End-of-Line Behavior</b>
    <br><br>
    One of the most common sources of frustration when working with text files
    on both UNIX-based and Windows-based systems is the fact that they use
    different end-of-line character sequences.  This can be annoying at best
    (e.g., not handling line breaks properly when looking at the file in a text
    editor), and at worst has the potential to break things (e.g., if a UNIX
    shell script has Windows line separators, then the interpreter might not be
    able to run it).
    <br><br>
    Subversion provides a solution to this problem by tagging the file at the
    time it is added to the repository to specify how end-of-line characters
    should be treated.  In OpenDS, we want to use the "native" style, which
    means that text files will have Windows-style CRLF line terminators when
    the code is checked out on a Windows system, or UNIX-style CR line
    terminators when the code is checked out on a UNIX system.  In order to
    configure your Subversion client to automatically tag text files in this
    way when adding them to the repository, edit the
    "<code>~/.subversion/config</code>" file (or
    "<code>%APPDATA%\Subversion\config</code>" on Windows) to make the
    following changes:

    <ul>
      <li>
        In the "<code>[miscellany]</code>" section, uncomment the line:
        <blockquote><code>enable-auto-props = yes</code></blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the following lines to the "<code>[auto-props]</code>" section:
        <blockquote>
          <code>*.java = svn:eol-style=native</code><br>
          <code>*.sh = svn:eol-style=native</code><br>
          <code>*.bat = svn:eol-style=native</code><br>
          <code>*.ldif = svn:eol-style=native</code><br>
          <code>*.txt = svn:eol-style=native</code><br>
          <code>*.xml = svn:eol-style=native</code><br>
          <code>*.html = svn:eol-style=native</code><br>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <b>Checking Out the Source Code</b>
    <br><br>
    Once the Subversion client is installed and configured, the only thing
    that you should need to be able to check out the source code is the URL of
    the repository.  The base URL for the OpenDS repository is
    "https://opends.dev.java.net/svn/opends", so the following command will
    check out the entire repository:

    <blockquote>
      <code>svn checkout --username yourusername https://opends.dev.java.net/svn/opends OpenDS</code>
    </blockquote>

    Where you would substitute your actual java.net username (or if you'd like
    you can use a username of "guest" with an empty password if you just want
    to check out the code and will never want to check anything in).

    While the above URL will work, in most cases you will want to pare it
    down somewhat to save time and disk space by only including the main OpenDS
    source.  You can do that by changing the URL to be
    "https://opends.dev.java.net/svn/opends/trunk/opends".  This will exclude
    all tags and branches that we have created, and will also skip the
    content for the OpenDS Website on java.net.  Over time, there will almost
    certainly be more content created outside of the trunk/opends portion of
    the tree that will likely not be needed in the majority of cases, so
    providing the URL to only retrieve the information below trunk/opends will
    be an even bigger savings in the future than it is today.
