    <div class="secpageheader">The OpenDS Project on java.net</div>

    <br>
    The majority of the OpenDS project is hosted at
    <a href="http://www.java.net/">java.net</a>, which provides a framework for
    Java-based open source applications that makes it possible for developers
    to spend more of their time and resources in development and less time in
    maintaining the project infrastructure.  In particular, OpenDS currently
    takes advantage of the following java.net offerings:

    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/">general website</a>
          provides a place for us to make project information available,
          including our documentation, FAQ, and other resources</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/source/browse/opends/">Subversion repository</a>
          hosts all of the project source</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">mailing lists</a>
          provide a mechanism for communicating between developers and
          users</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">issue tracker</a> holds information about all of the features, tasks, and defects
          associated with the project</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">downloads area</a>
          provides a mechanism for making files available for download (e.g.,
          our weekly builds)</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <b>Joining the OpenDS Project</b>
    <br><br>
    Much of the project content is available anonymously, but if you wish to
    participate on the mailing lists, file bugs or feature requests in the
    issue tracker, or take part in the development of the server, then you will
    need to join the project.  To do this:

    <ol>
      <li>
        If you don't already have one, get an account on java.net.  It's free
        and the only personal information you need to provide is an e-mail
        address.  To create an account, complete the form at
        <a href="https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/Join">https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/Join</a>.
        <br><br>
      </li>

      <li>
        Request a role in the OpenDS project at
        <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest">https://opends.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest</a>.
        You should initially request the "java-enterprise&gt;opends.User" role,
        which is available for anyone and will give you the ability to
        participate on OpenDS mailing lists and create issues in the issue
        tracker.
        <br><br>
      </li>

      <li>
        If you wish to contribute to the project in other ways (e.g., by
        writing code, documentation, or test cases), then you will need to
        complete and submit the
        <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/docs/dev-docs/OpenDS-Governance.html#sca_policy">Sun Contributor Agreement</a>.
        You may then send an e-mail message to
        <a href="mailto:contribution-request@opends.dev.java.net">contribution-request@opends.dev.java.net"</a>
        in order to request the Contributor role.
        <br><br>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <br>
    <b>Important OpenDS Mailing Lists</b>
    <br><br>
    Once you have joined the project, you will probably also want to subscribe
    to one or more of our e-mail mailing lists to keep up with what's
    happening.  You can see the full set of mailing lists available at
    <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">https://opends.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList</a>,
    where you can also subscribe to any or all of these lists on either a
    message-by-message basis (in which you'll get each individual e-mail
    message sent to the list) or in digest mode (in which you'll get one
    message a day that contains all of that day's traffic on that list).

    <br><br>
    The mailing list page provides information about all lists in the project,
    but the most useful lists for someone who wants to participate in the
    project development include:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="mailto:announce@opends.dev.java.net">announce@opends.dev.java.net</a>
        -- This is an extremely low-traffic list that we will use to provide
        important announcements related to the OpenDS project.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="mailto:commits@opends.dev.java.net">commits@opends.dev.java.net</a>
        -- This list will automatically be sent an e-mail message whenever
        someone commits something into the OpenDS Subversion repository.  That
        message will include information about the files that were changed, as
        well as a diff of those changes.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="mailto:daily-builds@opends.dev.java.net">daily-builds@opends.dev.java.net</a>
        -- This list will automatically be sent an e-mail message whenever the
        daily build completes, indicating whether the build was successful or
        failed for some reason.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="mailto:design-discuss@opends.dev.java.net">design-discuss@opends.dev.java.net</a>
        -- This list is intended for use by individuals discussing the design
        of components in the server before and during their development.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="mailto:dev@opends.dev.java.net">dev@opends.dev.java.net</a>
        -- This list is intended for use by OpenDS developers communicating
        with each other.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="mailto:issues@opends.dev.java.net">issues@opends.dev.java.net</a>
        -- This list will automatically be sent an e-mail message whenever
        someone creates or updates an issue in the issue tracker.  Note that in
        most cases, it will not be necessary to join this list because you will
        automatically be sent a message for updates to issues that you have
        created, issues assigned to you, or issues in which you are on the
        interest list.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="mailto:precommit-notification@opends.dev.java.net">precommit-notification@opends.dev.java.net</a>
        -- This list is intended for use by individuals for reviewing and
        commenting on code changes that have been proposed for committing to
        the repository.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="mailto:technical-questions@opends.dev.java.net">technical-questions@opends.dev.java.net</a>
        -- This list is intended for use by users who wish to ask technical
        questions of the OpenDS developers.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="mailto:users@opends.dev.java.net">users@opends.dev.java.net</a>
        -- This list is intended for use by users who wish to ask general
        questions, provide feedback or comments, or other general messages
        about OpenDS.
        <br><br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    Note that most of the OpenDS mailing lists are configured to automatically
    allow posts by members subscribed to the list, but to require moderation
    (explicit approval from a project owner) for any message sent by someone
    who is not subscribed to that list.  This means that if you send a message
    to a list to which you are not subscribed, then it may take some time for
    the message to be delivered while it is waiting for moderation, and you may
    not see any replies because they will generally be delivered only to list
    members.  Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you only send
    messages to a list if you are subscribed to it.
