    <br>
    Matching rule uses may be used to specify which attribute types may be used
    in conjunction with a given matching rule when processing a search request
    with an extensible match filter component.  If that extensible match
    component includes both an attribute type and a matching rule ID, then the
    server will check to see if there is a matching rule use for the associated
    matching rule, and if there is then it will ensure that it allows the
    specified attribute type to be used with that matching rule.

    <br><br>
    <b>The Matching Rule Use Description Format</b>
    <br><br>
    The matching rule use description format is described in
    <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc4512.txt">RFC 4512"</a>,
    section 4.1.4.  That definition is as follows:

    <blockquote><pre>     MatchingRuleUseDescription = LPAREN WSP
         numericoid                 ; object identifier
         [ SP "NAME" SP qdescrs ]   ; short names (descriptors)
         [ SP "DESC" SP qdstring ]  ; description
         [ SP "OBSOLETE" ]          ; not active
         SP "APPLIES" SP oids       ; attribute types
         extensions WSP RPAREN      ; extensions</pre></blockquote>

    The elements of the matching rule use description include:
    <ul>
      <li>The numeric OID of the matching rule with which the matching rule use
          is associated.  There may be most one matching rule use associated
          with a given matching rule.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of human-readable names that may be used to refer to
          the matching rule use.  If there is a single name, then it should be
          enclosed in single quotes.  If there are multiple names, then they
          should each be enclosed in single quotes and separated by spaces, and
          the entire set of names should be enclosed in
          parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional human-readable description.  If there is a description,
          then it should be enclosed in single quotes.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional "OBSOLETE" flag that may be used to indicate whether the
          matching rule use is active.  If it is marked "OBSOLETE", then it
          should not be taken into account when determining whether to allow
          an extensible match filter.<br><br></li>
      <li>A set of one or more attribute types that may be used in conjunction
          with the associated matching rule.  If there is an associated
          attribute type, then its name or OID may be used.  If there are
          multiple attribute types, then they should be separated by spaces and
          dollar signs, and the entire set of associated attribute types should
          be enclosed in parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of extensions for the matching rule use.  OpenDS
          currently uses the following extensions for matching rule uses:
          <ul>
            <li>X-ORIGIN -- Provides information about where the matching rule
                use is defined (e.g., whether it came from a particular RFC or
                Internet Draft, is defined within the OpenDS project,
                etc.).</li>
            <li>X-SCHEMA-FILE -- Indicates which schema file contains the
                matching rule use definition (this is generally used for
                internal purposes only and does not get exposed to
                clients).</li>
          </ul>
          <br></li>
    </ul>

    The following provides an example of a matching rule use description:

    <blockquote>
      <code>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.999.10 NAME 'testAddMRUSuccessful' APPLIES cn )</code>
    </blockquote>

    In this case, the numeric OID is "1.3.6.1.4.1.26027.1.999.10", the single
    human-readable name is "testAddMRUSuccessful", and it may be used in
    conjunction with the cn attribute.  It does not have a description, it is
    not marked "OBSOLETE", and it does not have any extensions.

    <br><br>
    <b>The OpenDS Matching Rule Use Implementation</b>
    <br><br>
    Matching rule uses may be created using only the information in the
    schema configuration files, in the matching rule use description syntax.
    All matching rule use objects are instances of the
    <code>org.opends.server.types.MatchingRuleUse</code> class.  Matching rule
    uses may be retrieved from the server schema by their associated matching
    rule.
