    <div class="secpageheader">The Entry Schema Checking Process</div>

    <br>
    During the course of processing add, modify, and modify DN operations, the
    server needs to check the resulting entry to ensure that it meets the
    requirements defined in the server schema (no such processing is necessary
    for delete operations, nor for read-only operations like bind, search, and
    compare).  The schema validation process is performed for the entry in the
    <code>org.opends.server.types.Entry</code> class using the method with the
    following signature:

    <blockquote><pre>public boolean conformsToSchema(Entry parentEntry,
                                boolean parentProvided,
                                boolean validateNameForms,
                                boolean validateStructureRules,
                                StringBuilder invalidReason)</pre></blockquote>

    This method indicates whether the current entry is in conformance with the
    server schema, and if not will append the reason to the provided
    <code>StringBuilder</code> buffer.  Although this method does contain a
    core set of validation that will always be performed, the arguments that
    the caller may provide can allow it to skip some processing if it is not
    required.  In particular, modify operations will neither impact the DN of
    an entry nor its position in the server hierarchy, so there is no need to
    perform name form or DIT structure rule validation for such operations.
    Further, DIT structure rule validation will also be skipped during LDIF
    imports because it requires access to the parent entry which will generally
    not be available while the import is in progress.

    <br><br>
    The processing performed by this method to determine whether an entry is
    in compliance with the server schema configuration is as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>Determine the structural object class for the entry.  As previously
          noted, each entry must have exactly one structural object class.  If
          the entry is found to contain multiple independent structural object
          classes, or if the entry does not have a structural class, then it
          will consult the server's single structural object class policy and
          either reject the entry (which is the default behavior) or ignore
          this error and continue processing (optionally sending a warning
          message to the error log).  If processing should continue and the
          entry was found to have multiple structural classes, then the first
          one found will be considered the structural class for that entry for
          the remainder of the validation process.<br><br></li>
      <li>If the entry does have a structural object class, then the server
          will retrieve any DIT content rule from the server schema that is
          associated with that structural class.  Further, if name form
          validation is to be performed, then the server will retrieve any name
          form associated with that structural class.  Finally, if there was an
          associated name form and DIT structure rule validation is to be
          performed, then the server will retrieve any DIT structure rule
          associated with that name form.  If any of these elements is declared
          OBSOLETE in the server schema, then the server will treat them as if
          they did not exist.<br><br></li>
      <li>All of the object classes in the entry will be examined to ensure
          that they are defined in the server schema and that all of the
          required attribute types associated with those object classes are
          present in the entry.  Further, if there is an applicable DIT content
          rule, then it will be used to determine whether all of the auxiliary
          classes contained in the entry are allowed.<br><br></li>
      <li>All of the user attributes in the entry will be examined to ensure
          that they are allowed by at least one of the entry's object classes
          or the associated DIT content rule.  Also, each user attribute type
          defined with a SINGLE-VALUE constraint will be checked to ensure that
          it does only contain one value.<br><br></li>
      <li>All of the operational attributes in the entry will be examined to
          ensure that if it is defined with a SINGLE-VALUE constraint that it
          does contain only one value.<br><br></li>
      <li>If name form validation is to be performed and there is an associated
          name form for the entry's structural object class, then the server
          will verify that all of its required attribute types are included in
          the entry's RDN, and that the RDN does not contain any attribute
          types which are not allowed.<br><br></li>
      <li>If the entry has an associated DIT content rule, then the server will
          ensure that all of its required attribute types and none of its
          prohibited attribute types are present in the entry.<br><br></li>
      <li>If DIT structure rule validation is to be performed and there is a
          DIT structure rule that applies to the entry which contains one or
          more superior rules, then the server will ensure that an entry with
          the associated structural class is allowed to exist below an entry
          with the parent's structural class.<br><br></li>
      <li>If DIT structure rule validation is to be performed but there is no
          associated DIT structure rule for the entry or there is such a rule
          but it does not have any superior rules, then the server will
          retrieve the parent entry and determine whether there is any DIT
          structure rule that may apply to it.  If there is an applicable DIT
          structure rule for the parent entry, then the server will not allow
          any children for that entry unless they are covered by a DIT
          structure rule that contains the parent's DIT structure rule as one
          of its superior rules.<br><br></li>
    </ol>
