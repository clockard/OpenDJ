    <br>
    DIT content rules provide a mechanism for defining the content that may
    appear in an entry.  Like with name forms, at most one DIT content rule may
    be associated with an entry based on its structural object class.  If such
    a rule exists for an entry, then it will work in conjunction with the
    object classes contained in that entry to define which attribute types
    must, may, and must not be present in the entry, as well as which auxiliary
    classes that it may include.

    <br><br>
    DIT content rules are not supported in the Sun Java System Directory
    Server, but are a new feature that is available in OpenDS.

    <br><br>
    <b>The DIT Content Rule Description Format</b>
    <br><br>
    The DIT content rule description format is described in
    <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc4512.txt">RFC 4512</a>,
    section 4.1.6.  The definition is as follows:

    <blockquote><pre>     DITContentRuleDescription = LPAREN WSP
         numericoid                 ; object identifier
         [ SP "NAME" SP qdescrs ]   ; short names (descriptors)
         [ SP "DESC" SP qdstring ]  ; description
         [ SP "OBSOLETE" ]          ; not active
         [ SP "AUX" SP oids ]       ; auxiliary object classes
         [ SP "MUST" SP oids ]      ; attribute types
         [ SP "MAY" SP oids ]       ; attribute types
         [ SP "NOT" SP oids ]       ; attribute types
         extensions WSP RPAREN      ; extensions</pre></blockquote>

    The elements of the DIT content rule description include:
    <ul>
      <li>The numeric OID of the structural object class with which the DIT
          content rule is associated.  Although the specification requires a
          numeric OID, this should match the OID specified for the associated
          object class, so if the object class OID was non-numeric, then this
          OID should be as well.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of human-readable names that may be used to refer to
          the DIT content rule.  If there is a single name, then it should be
          enclosed in single quotes.  If there are multiple names, then they
          should each be enclosed in single quotes separated by spaces and the
          entire set of names should be enclosed in parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional human-readable description.  If a description is
          provided, then it should be enclosed in single quotation
          marks.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional "OBSOLETE" flag that may be used to indicate whether the
          DIT content rule is active.  If a DIT content rule is marked as
          "OBSOLETE", then it should not be in effect within the
          server.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional list of auxiliary object classes that may be present in
          entries with the associated structural class.  If no values are
          provided, then such entries will not be allowed to have any auxiliary
          object classes.  Values should be specified as the name(s) or OID(s)
          of the allowed auxiliary classes, and if there are multiple allowed
          auxiliary classes then they should be separated by spaces and dollar
          signs and the entire set of names should be enclosed in
          parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional list of attribute types that are required to be present
          in entries with the associated structural class.  This is in addition
          to the attribute types required by the object classes included in the
          entry, and these additional attribute types do not need to be allowed
          by any of those object classes.  Values should be specified as the
          name(s) or OID(s) of the required attribute types, and if there are
          multiple required attribute types then they should be separated by
          spaces and dollar signs and the entire set of required attribute
          types should be enclosed in parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional list of attribute types that may optionally be present in
          entries with the associated structural class.  This is in addition to
          the attribute types allowed by the object classes included in the
          entry.  Values should be specified as the name(s) or OID(s) of the
          optional attribute types, and if there are multiple optional
          attribute types then they should be separated by spaces and dollar
          signs and the entire set of optional attribute types should be
          enclosed in parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional list of attribute types that are prohibited from being
          present in entries with the associated structural class.  This list
          may not include any attribute types that are required by the
          structural class or any of the allowed auxiliary classes, but it may
          be used to prevent the inclusion of attribute types which would
          otherwise be allowed by one of those object classes.  Values should
          be specified as the name(s) or OID(s) of the prohibited attribute
          types, and if there are multiple prohibited types then they should be
          separated by spaces and dollar signs and the entire set of prohibited
          attribute types should be enclosed in parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of extensions for the DIT content rule.  OpenDS
          currently uses the following extensions for DIT content rules:
          <ul>
            <li>X-ORIGIN -- Provides information about where the DIT content
                rule is defined (e.g., whether it came from a particular RFC or
                Internet Draft, is defined within the OpenDS project,
                etc.)</li>
            <li>X-SCHEMA-FILE -- Indicates which schema file contains the DIT
                content rule definition (this is generally used for internal
                purposes only and does not get exposed to clients).
          </ul>
          <br></li>
    </ul>

    The following provides an example of a DIT content rule description:

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        ( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.2.2 NAME 'inetOrgPersonContentRule'
          AUX ( posixAccount $ shadowAccount $ authPasswordObject )
          MUST uid )</code>
    </blockquote>

    In this case, the numeric OID is "2.16.840.1.113730.3.2.2", which is the
    OID for the inetOrgPerson structural object class.  It has a human-readable
    name of "inetOrgPersonContentRule" and no description.  It allows entries
    containing the inetOrgPerson object class to also contain the posixAccount,
    shadowAccount, and authPasswordObject auxiliary classes, and those entries
    must contain the uid attribute type.  It is not marked "OBSOLETE", and it
    does not define any additional optional or prohibited attribute types, nor
    does it include any extensions.

    <br><br>
    <b>The OpenDS DIT Content Rule Implementation</b>
    <br><br>
    DIT content rules may be defined purely from the schema configuration files
    using the DIT content rule description syntax provided above.  All DIT
    content rule objects are instances of the
    <code>org.opends.server.types.DITContentRule</code> class.  DIT content
    rule objects may be retrieved from the server schema using the structural
    object class with which they are associated.

    <br><br>
    At the present time, the OpenDS mechanism used to handle DIT content rules
    varies from the LDAPv3 specification in the following ways:
    <ul>
      <li>The LDAPv3 specification states that if the structural object class
          used in an entry does not have a corresponding DIT content rule, then
          that entry is not allowed to contain any auxiliary object classes.
          Because the Sun Java System Directory Server does not support DIT
          content rules, OpenDS will not prevent the use of auxiliary object
          classes in entries for which there is no corresponding DIT content
          rule.  If it is desirable to prevent the inclusion of auxiliary
          classes in a given type of entry, then a DIT content rule should be
          created with no allowed auxiliary classes to cover entries with the
          appropriate structural object class.<br><br></li>
    </ul>
