    <br>
    DIT structure rules may be used to define the allowed hierarchical
    structure of the directory data.  In particular, they make it possible to
    specify what types of entries will be allowed to exist as immediate
    children of entries with a specified structural object class (e.g., only
    entries with the <code>inetOrgPerson</code> structural class may be
    immediate children of entries with an <code>organizationalUnit</code>
    structural object class).

    <br><br>
    DIT structure rules are themselves hierarchical.  Each DIT structure rule
    is assigned a rule ID, which is an integer value, and is also associated
    with a name form (which in turn links it to a structural object class).
    DIT structure rules may also reference one or more superior DIT structure
    rules, and this provides the mechanism for controlling the data hierarchy.
    If a DIT structure rule does not specify any superior rules, then entries
    containing its associated structural object class are allowed to exist at
    the root of the associated schema.  If it does specify one or more superior
    rules, then entries with its associated structural object class will only
    be allowed to exist below entries containing the structural object class
    of one of those superior rules.

    <br><br>
    <b>The DIT Structure Rule Description Format</b>
    <br><br>
    The DIT structure rule description format is described in
    <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc4512.txt">RFC 4512</a>,
    section 4.1.7.1.  The defintion is as follows:

    <blockquote><pre>     DITStructureRuleDescription = LPAREN WSP
         ruleid                     ; rule identifier
         [ SP "NAME" SP qdescrs ]   ; short names (descriptors)
         [ SP "DESC" SP qdstring ]  ; description
         [ SP "OBSOLETE" ]          ; not active
         SP "FORM" SP oid           ; NameForm
         [ SP "SUP" ruleids ]       ; superior rules
         extensions WSP RPAREN      ; extensions

     ruleids = ruleid / ( LPAREN WSP ruleidlist WSP RPAREN )
     ruleidlist = ruleid *( SP ruleid )
     ruleid = number</pre></blockquote>

    The elements of the DIT structure rule description include:
    <ul>
      <li>The integer rule ID assigned to the DIT structure rule.  It must be
          unique among all other DIT structure rules in the
          schema.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of human-readable names that may be used to refer to
          the DIT structure rule.  If there is a single name, then it should be
          enclosed in single quotes.  If there are multiple names, then they
          should each be enclosed in single quotes separated by spaces, and the
          entire set of names should be enclosed in parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional human-readable description.  If a description is
          provided, then it should be enclosed in single quotes.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional "OBSOLETE" flag that may be used to indicate whether the
          DIT structure rule is active.  If it is marked "OBSOLETE", then it
          should not be taken into account when entries are created or
          moved.<br><br></li>
      <li>The name or OID of the name form with which the DIT structure rule is
          associated.  As mentioned above, the name form associates the DIT
          structure rule with a structural object class.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of superior rule IDs for the DIT structure rule.  If
          there are multiple superior rule IDs, then they should be separated
          by spaces and the entire set of superior rule IDs should be enclosed
          in parentheses.  It is permissible for multiple DIT structure rules
          to use overlapping sets of superior rule IDs.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of extensions for the DIT structure rule.  OpenDS
          currently uses the following extensions for DIT structure rules:
          <ul>
            <li>X-ORIGIN -- Provides information about where the DIT structure
                rule is defined (e.g., whether it came from a particular RFC or
                Internet Draft, is defined within the OpenDS project,
                etc.).</li>
            <li>X-SCHEMA-FILE -- Indicates which schema file contains the DIT
                structure rule definition (this is generally used for internal
                purposes only and does not get exposed to clients).</li>
          </ul>
          <br></li>
    </ul>

    For example, the following is the DIT structure rule definition for the
    <code>uddiContactStructureRule</code> DIT structure rule:

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        ( 2 NAME 'uddiContactStructureRule' FORM uddiContactNameForm SUP ( 1 )
          X-ORIGIN 'RFC 4403' )</code>
    </blockquote>

    In this case, the rule ID is "2", and the human-readable name is
    "uddiContactStructureRule".  It is associated with the uddiContactNameForm
    name form (which in turn links it to the uddiContact object class), and it
    has a superior rule ID of "1".  It was defined in RFC 4403.  It does not
    have a description, nor is it marked "OBSOLETE".

    <br><br>
    <b>DIT Structure Rules and Multiple Schemas</b>
    <br><br>
    DIT structure rules may provide a mechanism for placing constraints on the
    server hierarchy, but in order to maximize their utility it may be
    necessary to use them in conjunction with support for multiple schemas.
    For example, consider a directory with a naming context of
    "dc=example,dc=com", below which are two branches:
    "ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" and "ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com".  If you
    wish to only allow <code>inetOrgPerson</code> entries below the
    "ou=People" branch, and only <code>groupOfNames</code> entries below the
    "ou=Groups" branch, then that can only be fully accomplished if there are
    different schemas that govern the "ou=People" and "ou=Groups" branches.

    <br><br>
    If there were a single schema governing the entire server, then you can
    imagine that it would have four DIT structure rules:
    <ul>
      <li><code>( 1 NAME 'domainStructureRule' FORM 'domainNameForm' )</code></li>
      <li><code>( 2 NAME 'organizationalUnitStructureRule' FORM 'organizationalUnitNameForm' SUP 1 )</code></li>
      <li><code>( 3 NAME 'inetOrgPersonStructureRule' FORM 'inetOrgPersonNameForm' SUP 2 )</code></li>
      <li><code>( 4 NAME 'groupOfNamesStructureRule' FORM 'groupOfNamesNameForm' SUP 2 )</code></li>
    </ul>

    This set of DIT structure rules would allow the structure described above,
    but it would also allow the creation of group entries below the "ou=People"
    branch and the creation of user entries below the "ou=Gropus" branch.  The
    only way to prevent that using DIT structure rules would be to define
    separate schemas for the "ou=People" and "ou=Groups" branches and only
    define the "inetOrgPersonStructureRule" rule in the schema for the
    "ou=People" branch, and only define the "groupOfNamesStructureRule" rule in
    the schema for the "ou=Groups" branch.

    <br><br>
    More information about the potential use for multiple schemas in OpenDS
    will be described in a <a href="multipleschemas.html">later section</a>.

    <br><br>
    <b>The OpenDS DIT Structure Rule Implementation</b>
    <br><br>
    DIT structure rules may be defined purely from the information contained in
    the schema configuration files using the DIT structure rule description
    syntax provided above.  All DIT structure rule objects are instances of the
    <code>org.opends.server.types.DITStructureRule</code> class.  DIT structure
    rules may be retrieved from the server schema using either the integer rule
    ID or their associated name form.
