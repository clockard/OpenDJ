    <br>
    Matching rules are used by the Directory Server to compare two values for
    the same attribute (i.e., to perform matching operations on them).  There
    are several different types of matching rules, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Equality Matching Rules -- these matching rules are used to determine
          whether two values are logically equal to each other.  Different
          implementations of equality matching rules may use different criteria
          for making this determination (e.g., whether to ignore differences in
          capitalization, deciding which spaces are significant,
          etc.).<br><br></li>
      <li>Ordering Matching Rules -- these matching rules are used to determine
          the relative order for two values, for example when evaluating
          greater-or-equal or less-or-equal searches, or when the results need
          to be sorted.<br><br></li>
      <li>Substring Matching Rules -- these matching rules are used to
          determine whether a given substring assertion should match a
          particular value.  A substring assertion is comprised of at least one
          element from the following sets:  at most one subInitial element,
          zero or more subAny elements, and at most one subFinal
          element.<br><br></li>
      <li>Approximate Matching Rules -- these matching rules are used to
          determine whether two values are approximately equal to each other.
          This is frequently based on "sounds like" or some other kind of fuzzy
          algorithm.  Approximate matching rules are not part of the official
          LDAP specification, but we do include them in OpenDS for added
          flexibility.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <b>The Matching Rule Description Format</b>
    <br><br>
    The matching rule description format is described in
    <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc4512.txt">RFC 4512</a>,
    section 4.1.3.  This is the format that is used to display matching rules
    in the matchingRules attribute of the schema subentry, and it shows the
    properties that may be associated with a matching rule.  The definition of
    the matching rule description format is as follows:

    <blockquote><pre>     MatchingRuleDescription = LPAREN WSP
         numericoid                 ; object identifier
         [ SP "NAME" SP qdescrs ]   ; short names (descriptors)
         [ SP "DESC" SP qdstring ]  ; description
         [ SP "OBSOLETE" ]          ; not active
         SP "SYNTAX" SP numericoid  ; assertion syntax
         extensions WSP RPAREN      ; extensions</pre></blockquote>

    <br>
    The elements of the matching rule description include:
    <ul>
      <li>The numeric OID is used to uniquely identify the matching rule in
          the server.  Every matching rule must have a unique OID.<br><br></li>
      <li>The name elements are human-readable names assigned to the matching
          rule that may be used to refer to it in place of the OID.  A matching
          rule is not required to have any human-readable names.  If it has
          only a single name, then it will simply be enclosed in single quotes.
          If there are multiple names for a matching rule, each will be
          enclosed in single quotes with spaces between the names, and
          parentheses around the entire set of names.<br><br></li>
      <li>The description element is a human-readable description for the
          matching rule.  There may be at most one description, and if it is
          present then it should be enclosed in single quotation
          marks.<br><br></li>
      <li>The "<code>OBSOLETE</code>" flag indicates whether this matching rule
          should be considered available for use.  If a matching rule is marked
          "<code>OBSOLETE</code>", then it should not be possible to create any
          new attribute types or matching rule uses which reference this
          matching rule.<br><br></li>
      <li>The syntax element identifies the attribute syntax with which the
          matching rule is associated.  This is used to indicate the acceptable
          format for values on which the matching rule will operate.  More
          information about attribute syntaxes may be found in a
          <a href="attributesyntaxes.html">subsequent section</a> of this
          document.  The syntax OID must be included in all matching rule
          descriptions.<br><br></li>
      <li>The extensions for a matching rule may be used to identify other
          properties for that matching rule that may not be included in the
          standard definition.  OpenDS does not currently support any
          extensions for use in matching rules.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    For example, the following is the matching rule description for the
    standard <code>caseIgnoreMatch</code> matching rule:

    <blockquote>
      <code>( 2.5.13.2 NAME 'caseIgnoreMatch' SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )</code>
    </blockquote>

    <br>
    In this case, the OID is "2.5.13.2".  There is one name, which is
    "caseIgnoreMatch".  There is no description.  The OID of the associated
    syntax is 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 (which is the Directory String
    syntax).  There are no extensions.

    <br><br><br>
    <b>Commonly-Used Matching Rules</b>
    <br><br>
    There are a number of matching rules defined in LDAP, both in the core
    protocol specification, as well as other related RFCs and Internet Drafts.
    Many of these matching rules are defined in
    <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc4517.txt">RFC 4517</a>
    (LDAP Syntaxes and Matching Rules), in section 4.2.  Some of the most
    commonly-used matching rules include:
    <ul>
      <li><code>caseIgnoreMatch</code>, <code>caseIgnoreOrderingMatch</code>,
          <code>caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch</code> -- these are equality,
          ordering, and substring matching rules, respectively, which ignore
          differences in capitalization and also treat multiple consecutive
          spaces as a single space.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>caseExactMatch</code>, <code>caseExactOrderingMatch</code>,
          <code>caseExactSubstringsMatch</code> -- these are equality,
          ordering, and substring matching rules, respectively, which treat
          values in a case-sensitive manner but do treat multiple consecutive
          spaces as a single space.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>octetStringMatch</code>, <code>octetStringOrderingMatch</code>,
          <code>octetStringSubstringsMatch</code> -- these are equality,
          ordering, and substring matching rules, respectively, which perform
          byte-for-byte comparisons of the values, treating them as binary data
          rather than strings.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>numericStringMatch</code>,
          <code>numericStringOrderingMatch</code>,
          <code>numericStringSubstringsMatch</code> -- these are equality,
          ordering, and substring matching rules, respectively, which operate
          on values that start with a numeric digit, and contain only numeric
          digits and spaces.  Spaces are ignored when performing matching with
          these matching rules.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>distinguishedNameMatch</code> -- this is an equality matching
          rule that operates on distinguished name (DN) values.  It ignores
          spaces around the commas or semicolons that separate DN components,
          spaces around plus signs that separate RDN components, and spaces
          around equal signs that separate RDN attribute type names from their
          corresponding values.  Differences in capitalization are ignored for
          attribute type names.  Equality matching for attribute values is
          performed using the equality matching rule for the corresponding
          attribute type.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>doubleMetaphoneApproximateMatch</code> -- this is an
          approximate matching rule that uses the double metaphone algorithm to
          perform a "sounds like" comparison.  Note that this matching rule is
          not part of any official LDAP specification, but we do include it in
          OpenDS for added flexibility.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <b>Value Normalization</b>
    <br><br>
    One of the tasks that most matching rules need to perform is value
    normalization.  This is the process of transforming a given value to a form
    that can be used to compare values efficiently.  In most cases, the
    normalization process should reduce all logically equivalent values to the
    same string so that a very simple string comparison can be performed to
    determine whether the strings are equal.  For example, the
    <code>caseIgnoreMatch</code> matching rule will typically normalize values
    by converting all characters to lowercase and replacing occurrences of
    multiple consecutive spaces with a single space.  A more complicated
    example is the <code>distinguishedNameMatch</code> matching rule, which
    removes all unnecessary spaces (e.g., around commas, equal signs, and plus
    signs), converts all attribute types to lowercase, and then uses the
    appropriate matching rules to normalize the attribute values for each RDN
    component.

    <br><br>
    Note that in some cases, normalization alone is not sufficient for
    determining whether two values are logically equivalent.  This is
    particularly true for cases in which the value is transformed, and there
    can be multiple different transformations for the same value.  For example,
    this is often done for the <code>userPassword</code> attribute type, where
    values may be encoded using a one-way message digest algorithm, and if that
    algorithm includes a salt then each time a given value is encoded it may
    result in a different string (in fact, this is the intended behavior, which
    helps prevent dictionary attacks).  In cases like this, the matching rule
    simply needs to use different logic to determine equality, rather than
    relying solely on normalization.

    <br><br><br>
    <b>The OpenDS Matching Rule Implementation</b>
    <br><br>
    Because matching rules require logic to perform the appropriate kinds of
    matching operations, they must be implemented in code.  All matching rules
    in OpenDS must be subclasses of the
    <code>org.opends.server.api.MatchingRule</code> class, and most of them
    should be subclasses of one of the following classes (each of which is a
    subclass of <code>org.opends.server.api.MatchingRule</code>):
    <ul>
      <li><code>org.opends.server.api.EqualityMatchingRule</code>
      <li><code>org.opends.server.api.OrderingMatchingRule</code>
      <li><code>org.opends.server.api.SubstringMatchingRule</code>
      <li><code>org.opends.server.api.ApproximateMatchingRule</code>
    </ul>

    All of the matching rule implementations that are provided as part of
    OpenDS are included in the <code>org.opends.server.schema</code> package.
    When a new matching rule class is implemented, a corresponding
    configuration entry should be added below the
    "<code>cn=Matching Rules,cn=config</code>" entry.  For example, the
    configuration entry that defines the <code>caseIgnoreMatch</code> equality
    matching rule is as follows:

    <blockquote><pre>dn: cn=Case Ignore Equality Matching Rule,cn=Matching Rules,cn=config
objectClass: top
objectClass: ds-cfg-matching-rule
objectClass: ds-cfg-equality-matching-rule
cn: Case Ignore Equality Matching Rule
ds-cfg-matching-rule-class: org.opends.server.schema.CaseIgnoreEqualityMatchingRule
ds-cfg-matching-rule-enabled: true</pre></blockquote>

    <br>
    The most important methods from the
    <code>org.opends.server.api.MatchingRule</code> class that matching rules
    need to implement are:

    <blockquote><pre>public ByteString normalizeValue(ByteString value)
       throws DirectoryException

public ConditionResult valuesMatch(ByteString attributeValue,
                                   ByteString assertionValue)</pre></blockquote>

    <br>
    Equality matching rules need to implement the following method from the
    <code>org.opends.server.api.EqualityMatchingRule</code> class:

    <blockquote><pre>public boolean areEqual(ByteString value1, ByteString value2)</pre></blockquote>

    <br>
    Ordering matching rules need to implement the following method from the
    <code>org.opends.server.api.OrderingMatchingRule</code> class:

    <blockquote><pre>public int compareValues(ByteString value1, ByteString value2)</pre></blockquote>

    <br>
    Substring matching rules need to implement the following two methods from
    the <code>org.opends.server.api.SubstringMatchingRule</code> class:

    <blockquote><pre>public ByteString normalizeSubstring(ByteString substring)
       throws DirectoryException

public boolean valueMatchesSubstring(ByteString value,
                                     ByteString subInitial,
                                     List<ByteString> subAnyElements,
                                     ByteString subFinal)</pre></blockquote>

    <br>
    Approximate matching rules need to implement the following method from the
    <code>org.opends.server.api.ApproximateMatchingRule</code> class:

    <blockquote><pre>public boolean approximatelyMatch(ByteString value1,
                                  ByteString value2)</pre></blockquote>

    <br>
    Matching rule objects may be retrieved from the server schema using their
    OIDs or any of their human-readable names.
