    <div class="secpageheader">The OpenDS Schema Backend</div>

    <br>
    The schema backend is the mechanism that OpenDS uses to make schema
    information available to external clients.  Clients may query this backend
    to retrieve information about the matching rules, attribute syntaxes,
    attribute types, object classes, name forms, DIT content rules, DIT
    structure rules, and matching rule uses defined in the server.  It also
    provides support for modify operations which can be used to update the
    server schema.

    <br><br>
    The behavior of the OpenDS schema backend is largely governed by
    <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc2251.txt">RFC 2251</a>,
    section 3.2.2 and
    <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc4512.txt">RFC 4512</a>,
    section 4.2, particuarly for read operations.  The schema backend presents
    a single entry (by default it is "<code>cn=schema</code>", which matches
    the value used by the Sun Java System Directory Server, although this can
    be customized if necessary).  This entry contains the
    <code>subschemaSubentry</code> object class, and makes the server schema
    elements available through the following attribute types:
    <ul>
      <li><code>matchingRules</code>
      <li><code>ldapSyntaxes</code>
      <li><code>attributeTypes</code>
      <li><code>objectClasses</code>
      <li><code>nameForms</code>
      <li><code>dITContentRules</code>
      <li><code>dITStructureRules</code>
      <li><code>matchingRuleUse</code>
    </ul>

    All of these attribute types have <code>directoryOperation</code> usage,
    which means that they will be treated as operational by the server, and
    will not be returned unless the client explicitly requests them.  This is
    the correct standards-compliant behavior, but it is different from the
    behavior exhibited by the Sun Java System Directory Server, which will
    always treat the <code>matchingRules</code>, <code>attributeTypes</code>, 
    and <code>objectClasses</code> attributes as user attributes.  Because it
    is possible that some developers have written code to depend on the fact
    that the server will always return these attributes by default, then OpenDS
    includes a configuration option (<code>ds-cfg-show-all-attributes</code> in
    the <code>ds-cfg-backend-id=schema,cn=Backends,cn=config</code> entry).

    <br><br>
    As noted above, the schema backend also provides a mechanism for clients to
    alter the server schema through modify operations.  This interface can be
    used to add new schema elements, remove existing schema elements, or
    replace existing elements with a new definition.  These operations can be
    done using a combination of the <code>ADD</code> and <CODE>DELETE</code>
    modification types (the <code>REPLACE</code> modification type is not
    supported for updating the schema, and the <code>INCREMENT</code> type
    doesn't doesn't make any sense in this context):
    <ul>
      <li>In order to add a new schema element that does not exist, use the
          <code>ADD</code> modification type to add it.<br><br></li>
      <li>In order to complete remove a schema element from the server, use the
          <code>DELETE</code> modification type to remove it.<br><br></li>
      <li>In order to replace an existing schema element, use the
          <code>DELETE</code> modification type to remove the existing element
          and the <code>ADD</code> modification type to add the new version in
          the same modification.  If the <code>DELETE</code> and
          <code>ADD</code> operations are included in the same modification,
          then the server will not enforce all of the restrictions that would
          otherwise be in place when removing a schema element.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    In any case, the format used for the value should be based on the
    description syntax associated with that type of schema element (e.g., in
    order to alter the attribute type definitions, the attribute type
    description syntax should be used).

    <br><br>
    When adding a new schema element to the server, the primary requirements
    are that it should be a valid definition according to the corresponding
    syntax, and that it does not reference any other schema elements that do
    not exist or that are marked as <code>OBSOLETE</code>.  The dependencies
    that must be satisfied when adding schema elements include:
    <ul>
      <li>For attribute types, the attribute syntax, matching rules, and
          superior attribute type</li>
      <li>For object classes, the required and optional attribute types and the
          superior object class</li>
      <li>For name forms, the required and optional attribute types and the
          structural object class</li>
      <li>For DIT content rules, the required, optional, and prohibited
          attribute types and the structural and auxiliary object classes</li>
      <li>For DIT structure rules, the name form and superior DIT structure
          rules</li>
      <li>For matching rule uses, the matching rule and referenced attribute
          types</li>
    </ul>

    When removing an existing schema element in the server (and not re-adding
    it in the same modification), the primary requirements are that it should
    be a valid definition according to the corresponding syntax, and that
    there are no other schema elements that reference it.  The dependencies
    that must be satisfied when removing schema elements include:
    <ul>
      <li>For an attribute type, no other attribute type may reference it as a
          superior type, it must not be required or allowed by any object
          class or name form, it must not be required, allowed, or prohibited
          by any DIT content rule, and it must not be referenced by any
          matching rule</li>
      <li>For an object class, no other object class may reference it as a
          superior class, it must not be the structural class for any name
          form, and it must not be referenced as a structural or auxiliary
          class for any DIT content rule</li>
      <li>For a name form, it must not be referenced by any DIT structure
          rule</li>
      <li>For a DIT structure rule, it must not be referenced as a superior
          rule for any other DIT structure rule</li>
    </ul>

    When replacing an existing schema element, it is treated with essentially
    the same requirements as an add.  The restrictions on removing the element
    are not enforced if it is re-added in the same operation.

    <br><br>
    When adding a new schema element, it will be placed in the
    <code>99-user.ldif</code> schema file by default, unless the definition for
    the element explicitly specifies a different file using the
    <code>X-SCHEMA-FILE</code> extension.  When removing or replacing an
    existing schema element, the file containing the existing definition will
    be updated.
