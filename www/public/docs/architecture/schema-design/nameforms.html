    <br>
    Name forms may be used to define a mechanism for naming entries in the
    server.  In particular, a name form specifies one or more attribute types
    which must be present in the RDN of an entry with a given structural object
    class, as well as zero or more attribute types which may optionally be
    present in the RDN.

    <br><br>
    Each structural object class defined in the server schema may be associated
    with at most one name form.  If a name form is defined for a given
    structural object class, then the associated name form will be enforced for
    any add or modify DN operations for entries containing that object class.
    If a structural object class is not associated with a name form, then any
    attribute type which is allowed to exist in the target entry may be used as
    a naming attribute type.

    <br><br>
    Name forms are not supported in the Sun Java System Directory Server, but
    are a new feature that is available in OpenDS.

    <br><br>
    <b>The Name Form Description Format</b>
    <br><br>
    The name form description format is described in
    <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc4512.txt">RFC 4512</a>,
    section 4.1.7.2.  The definition is as follows:

    <blockquote><pre>     NameFormDescription = LPAREN WSP
         numericoid                 ; object identifier
         [ SP "NAME" SP qdescrs ]   ; short names (descriptors)
         [ SP "DESC" SP qdstring ]  ; description
         [ SP "OBSOLETE" ]          ; not active
         SP "OC" SP oid             ; structural object class
         SP "MUST" SP oids          ; attribute types
         [ SP "MAY" SP oids ]       ; attribute types
         extensions WSP RPAREN      ; extensions</pre></blockquote>

    The elements of the name form description include:
    <ul>
      <li>The numeric OID used to uniquely identify the name form in the
          server.  Although the specification requires a numeric OID, OpenDS
          also allows a non-numeric OID for the purpose of convenience.  In
          this case, the non-numeric OID should be the same as the name of the
          name form followed by the string "-oid".<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of human-readable names that may be used to refer to
          the name form.  If there is a single name, then it should be enclosed
          in single quotes.  If there are multiple names, then they should each
          be enclosed in single quotes separated by spaces and the entire set
          of names should be enclosed in parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional human-readable description.  If a description is present,
          then it should be enclosed in single quotation marks.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional "OBSOLETE" flag that may be used to indicate whether the
          name form is active.  If a name form is marked as "OBSOLETE", then it
          should not be in effect within the server, nor should it be possible
          to create any other elements that depend upon it.<br><br></li>
      <li>The name or OID of the structural object class with which the name
          form is associated.<br><br></li>
      <li>The name(s) or OID(s) of one or more attribute types that must be
          present in the RDN for any entry with the specified structural class.
          If there is only a single required attribute type, then only its name
          or OID needs to be given.  If there are multiple required attribute
          types, then they should be separated by spaces and dollar signs, and
          the entire set of required attribute types should be enclosed in
          parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>The name(s) or OID(s) of zero or more attribute types that may
          optionally be present in the RDN for any entry with the specified
          structural class.  If there is only a single optional attribute type,
          then only its name or OID needs to be given.  If there are multiple
          optional attribute types, then they should be separated by spaces and
          dollar signs, and the entire set of optional attribute types should
          be enclosed in parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of extensions for the name form.  OpenDS currently
          uses the following extensions for name forms:
          <ul>
            <li>X-ORIGIN -- Provides information about where the name form is
                defined (e.g., whether it came from a particular RFC or
                Internet Draft, is defined within the OpenDS project,
                etc.).</li>
            <li>X-SCHEMA-FILE -- Indicates which schema file contains the name
                form definition (this is generally used for internal purposes
                only and does not get exposed to clients).</li>
          </ul>
          <br></li>
    </ul>

    For example, the following is the name form description for the
    uddiBusinessEntityNameForm name form defined in
    <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc4403.txt">RFC 4403</a>:

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        ( 1.3.6.1.1.10.15.1 NAME 'uddiBusinessEntityNameForm'
          OC uddiBusinessEntity MUST ( uddiBusinessKey ) X-ORIGIN 'RFC 4403' )
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    In this case, the numeric OID is "1.3.6.1.1.10.15.1" and the human-readable
    name is "uddiBusinessEntityNameForm".  Entries with the
    <code>uddiBusinessEntity</code> structural object class are required to use
    <code>uddiBusinessKey</code> as their only RDN attribute type.  There is no
    description, nor are there any other attribute types that may optionally be
    included in the associated entries, and the name form is not marked
    "OBSOLETE".

    <br><br>
    <b>The OpenDS Name Form Implementation</b>
    <br><br>
    As for attribute types and object classes, name forms can be defined purely
    from the schema configuration files, in this case using the name form
    description syntax detailed above.  All name form instances in OpenDS are
    instances of the <code>org.opends.server.types.NameForm</code> class.  Name
    form objects may be retrieved by the server schema using their OID, any of
    their human-readable names, or by the structural object class with which
    they are associated.
