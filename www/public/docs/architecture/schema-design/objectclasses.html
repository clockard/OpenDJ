    <br>
    Object classes are essentially named sets of attribute types that may be
    used to control the type of data that may be stored in entries.  Note that
    the terms "object class" and "objectclass" (i.e., with and without a space
    between the words) are generally used interchangably.

    <br><br>
    <b>The Object Class Description Format</b>
    <br><br>
    The object class description format is described in
    <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc4512.txt">RFC 4512</a>,
    section 4.1.1.  The definition is as follows:

    <blockquote><pre>     ObjectClassDescription = LPAREN WSP
         numericoid                 ; object identifier
         [ SP "NAME" SP qdescrs ]   ; short names (descriptors)
         [ SP "DESC" SP qdstring ]  ; description
         [ SP "OBSOLETE" ]          ; not active
         [ SP "SUP" SP oids ]       ; superior object classes
         [ SP kind ]                ; kind of class
         [ SP "MUST" SP oids ]      ; attribute types
         [ SP "MAY" SP oids ]       ; attribute types
         extensions WSP RPAREN

     kind = "ABSTRACT" / "STRUCTURAL" / "AUXILIARY"</pre></blockquote>

    <br>
    The elements of the object class description include:
    <ul>
      <li>The numeric OID used to uniquely identify the object class in the
          server.  Although the specification requires a numeric OID, OpenDS
          also allows a non-numeric OID for the purpose of convenience and
          better compatibility with the Sun Java System Directory Server.  In
          this case, the non-numeric OID should be the same as the name of the
          object class followed by the string "-oid".<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of human-readable names that may be used to refer to
          the object class.  If there is a single name, then it should be
          enclosed in single quotes.  If there are multiple names, then they
          should each be enclosed in single quotes separated by spaces and the
          entire set of names should be enclosed in parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional human-readable description.  If there is a description,
          then it should be enclosed in single quotation marks.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional "OBSOLETE" flag that may be used to indicate whether the
          object class is active.  If an object class is marked as "OBSOLETE",
          then it should not be referenced by any new elements created in the
          server.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of superior class(es) for the object class.  Note
          that although technically the specification allows an object class to
          have multiple superior classes, OpenDS currently only supports a
          single superior class.  In this case, the "SUP" keyword should be
          followed by a space and the name or OID of the superior class.  If
          there are multiple superior classes, then they should be separated by
          dollar signs and the entire set of superior classes should be
          enclosed in parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional keyword that specifies the kind of object class that is
          being defined.  If this is specified, then it must be one of
          "ABSTRACT", "STRUCTURAL", or "AUXILIARY".  If no value is specified,
          then the object class will be considered "STRUCTURAL".<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of attribute types for attributes that are required
          to be present (i.e., have at least one value) in entries with that
          object class.  If there is only a single required attribute, then the
          "MUST" keyword should be followed by the name or OID of that
          attribute type.  If there are multiple required attribute types, then
          they should be separated by dollar signs and the entire set of
          required attribute types should be enclosed in
          parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of optional attribute types for attributes that are
          allowed (but not required) to be present in entries with that object
          class.  If there is only a single optional attribute, then  the "MAY"
          keyword should be followed by the name or OID of that attribute type.
          If there are multiple optional attribute types, then they should be
          separated by dollar signs and the entire set of optional attribute
          types should be enclosed in parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of extensions for the object class.  OpenDS currently
          uses the following extensions for object classes:
          <ul>
            <li><code>X-ORIGIN</code> -- Provides information about where the
                object class is defined (e.g., whether it came from a
                particular RFC or Internet Draft, is defined within the OpenDS
                project, etc.).</li>
            <li><code>X-SCHEMA-FILE</code> -- Indicates which schema file
                contains the object class definition (this is generally used
                for internal purposes only and does not get exposed to
                clients).</li>
          </ul>
          <br></li>
    </ul>

    For example, the following is the object class description for the standard
    <code>person</code> object class:

    <blockquote>
      <code>( 2.5.6.6 NAME 'person' SUP top STRUCTURAL MUST ( sn $ cn )
              MAY ( userPassword $ telephoneNumber $ seeAlso $ description )
              X-ORIGIN 'RFC 2256' )</code>
    </blockquote>

    In this case, the OID is "2.5.6.6".  There is a single human-readable name
    of "person".  The superior class is "top".  The kind is "STRUCTURAL".  Any
    entry containing the person object class will be required to include the sn
    and cn attributes, and will be allowed to include the userPassword,
    telephoneNumber, seeAlso, and description attributes.  The object class
    definition was taken from RFC 2256.  There is no description, and the
    object class is not considered "OBSOLETE".

    <br><br>
    <b>Object Class Kinds</b>
    <br><br>
    As described above, all object classes must have a kind of either
    "ABSTRACT", "STRUCTURAL", or "AUXILIARY".  These object class kinds may be
    described as follows:

    <ul>
      <li>Abstract object classes are only intended to be extended by other
          object classes.  An entry must not contain any abstract class unless
          it also contains a structural or auxiliary class that dervies from
          that abstract class (i.e., includes a non-abstract object class which
          has the abstract class in its inheritance chain).  All entries must
          contain at least the "top" abstract object class, in the inheritance
          chain for their structural class.  They may or may not contain other
          abstract classes in the inheritance chains for their structural class
          or any of their auxiliary classes.<br><br></li>
      <li>Structural object classes are intended to define the crux of what an
          entry represents.  Every entry must include exactly one structural
          object class chain, and the root of that chain must ultimately be the
          "top" abstract object class.  The structural object class for an
          entry is not allowed to be changed.<br><br></li>
      <li>Auxiliary object classes are intended to define additional qualities
          of entries.  An entry may contain zero or more auxiliary classes, and
          the set of auxiliary classes associated with an entry may change
          over time.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    The model represented by object class kinds translates very neatly to the
    model used by the Java programming language.  Abstract LDAP object classes
    map directly to Java abstract classes, auxiliary LDAP object classes map
    directly to Java interfaces, and structural LDAP object classes map
    directly to Java concrete (non-abstact) classes.  Just as Java classes must
    extend exactly one superclass but can implement any number of interfaces,
    so must LDAP entries contain exactly one structural class chain but can
    include any number of auxiliary class chains.  Similarly, just as it is not
    possible to directly instantiate an abstract Java class, it is also not
    possible to create an LDAP entry containing only abstract object classes.

    <br><br>
    Note that the Sun Java System Directory Server has never enforced many of
    the restrictions noted here around object class kinds.  In particular, it
    would allow the creation of entries that did not contain any structural
    object class chain, and would also allow the creation of entries containing
    multiple structural object class chains.  This means that some deployments
    using the Sun Java System Directory Server may contain entries that violate
    this constraint.  OpenDS will not allow this behavior by default, but for
    the sake of compatibility with existing Sun Java System Directory Server
    deployments, it will be possible to configure OpenDS to allow entries to
    violate this constraint, optionally writing a message to the server's error
    log each time this condition is detected.  Note, however, that if there are
    entries that do not contain exactly one structural object class, then some
    schema elements like name forms and DIT content rules which depend on this
    constraint may not work as expected in all cases.

    <br><br>
    <b>Object Class Inheritance</b>
    <br><br>
    As specified in the above description, object classes can have zero or more
    superior classes (although at the present time, OpenDS supports at most one
    superior class).  If an object class references a superior class, then all
    of the required and optional attributes associated with that superior class
    are also associated with the subordinate class.

    <br><br>
    The following restrictions exist for object class inheritance:
    <ul>
      <li>Abstract object classes may only inherit from other abstract classes.
          They may not be subordinate to structural or auxiliary
          classes.<br><br></li>
      <li>Structural object classes may only inherit from abstract classes or
          other structural classes.  They may not be subordinate to auxiliary
          object classes.<br><br></li>
      <li>Auxiliary object classes may only inherit from abstract classes or
          other auxiliary classes.  They may not be subordinate to structural
          object classes.<br><br></li>
      <li>All structural object classes must ultimately inherit from the top
          abstract object class.  The net effect of this is that every entry in
          the server must include the top object class, and as a result must
          also include the objectClass attribute type which is required by the
          top object class).<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    <b>The OpenDS Object Class Implementation</b>
    <br><br>
    Object classes in OpenDS do not require any custom logic and therefore they
    can be implemented as data structures which get populated from information
    contained in the schema configuration files, much in the same way as for
    attribute type definitions.  All object class instances in OpenDS are
    instances of the <code>org.opends.server.types.ObjectClass</code> class.
    Object class objects may be retrieved from the server schema using their
    OIDs or any of their human-readable names.

    <br><br>
    At the present time, the OpenDS mechanism used to handle object classes
    varies from the LDAPv3 specification in the following ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Object classes are allowed to have at most one superior class,
          whereas the specification allows multiple superior classes in some
          cases.<br><br></li>
    </ul>
