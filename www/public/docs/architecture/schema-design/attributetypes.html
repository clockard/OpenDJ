    <br>
    Attribute types define the set of attributes that may be used in the server
    and how operations involving that attribute should be conducted.  Among
    other things, it combines an attribute syntax and set of matching rules
    with a unique OID and human-readable names.

    <br><br>
    <b>The Attribute Type Description Format</b>
    <br><br>
    The attribute type description format is described in
    <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc4512.txt">RFC 4512</a>,
    section 4.1.2.  The definition is as follows:

    <blockquote><pre>     AttributeTypeDescription = LPAREN WSP
         numericoid                    ; object identifier
         [ SP "NAME" SP qdescrs ]      ; short names (descriptors)
         [ SP "DESC" SP qdstring ]     ; description
         [ SP "OBSOLETE" ]             ; not active
         [ SP "SUP" SP oid ]           ; supertype
         [ SP "EQUALITY" SP oid ]      ; equality matching rule
         [ SP "ORDERING" SP oid ]      ; ordering matching rule
         [ SP "SUBSTR" SP oid ]        ; substrings matching rule
         [ SP "SYNTAX" SP noidlen ]    ; value syntax
         [ SP "SINGLE-VALUE" ]         ; single-value
         [ SP "COLLECTIVE" ]           ; collective
         [ SP "NO-USER-MODIFICATION" ] ; not user modifiable
         [ SP "USAGE" SP usage ]       ; usage
         extensions WSP RPAREN         ; extensions

     usage = "userApplications"     /  ; user
             "directoryOperation"   /  ; directory operational
             "distributedOperation" /  ; DSA-shared operational
             "dSAOperation"            ; DSA-specific operational</pre></blockquote>

    <br>
    The elements of the attribute type description include:
    <ul>
      <li>The numeric OID used to uniquely identify the attribute type in the
          server.  Although the specification requires a numeric OID, OpenDS
          also allows a non-numeric OID for the purpose of convenience and
          better compatibility with the Sun Java System Directory Server.  In
          this case, the non-numeric OID should be the same as the name of the
          attribute type followed by the string "-oid".<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional set of human-readable names that may also be used to
          refer to the attribute type.  If there is a single name, then it
          should be enclosed in single quotes.  If there are multiple names,
          then they should each be enclosed in single quotes separated by
          spaces and the entire set of names should be enclosed in
          parentheses.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional human-readable description.  If there is a description,
          then it should be enclosed in single quotation marks.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional "OBSOLETE" flag that may be used to indicate whether the
          attribute type is active.  If an attribute type is marked as
          "OBSOLETE", then it means that it should not be referenced by any
          new elements created in the server.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional reference to the superior attribute type.  If there is a
          superior type, then it may be referenced by either its OID or any of
          its human-readable names.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional equality matching rule definition.  If a specific
          equality matching rule is provided, then it may be referenced by
          either its OID or any of its human-readable names.  If no equality
          matching rule is given, then the attribute type will use the default
          equality matching rule for the associated attribute syntax.  If the
          attribute syntax does not have a default equality matching rule, then
          equality matching operations will not be allowed for attributes of
          that type.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional ordering matching rule definition.  If a specific
          ordering matching rule is provided, then it may be referenced by
          either its OID or any of its human-readable names.  If no ordering
          matching rule is given, then the attribute type will use the default
          ordering matching rule for the associated attribute syntax.  If the
          attribute syntax does not have a default ordering matching rule, then
          ordering matching operations will not be allowed for attributes of
          that type.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional substring matching rule definition.  If a specific
          substring matching rule is provided, then it may be referenced by
          either its OID or any of its human-readable names.  If no substring
          matching rule is given, then the attribute type will use the default
          substring matching rule for the associated attribute syntax.  If the
          attribute syntax does not have a default substring matching rule,
          then substring matching operations will not be allowed for attributes
          of that type.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional attribute syntax for use with the attribute type.  If it
          is provided, then it should be given as a numeric OID.  The syntax
          identifier may also optionally contain an integer value enclosed in
          curly braces directly following the OID (without any spaces between
          the last digit of the OID and the opening curly brace), which may be
          used to suggest a minimum upper bound on the length of values for
          attributes of that type.  OpenDS does not enforce any maximum length
          restrictions for attribute values, so if a length is given then it
          will be ignored.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional "SINGLE-VALUE" flag, which indicates that attributes of
          that type will only be allowed to have a single value in any entry in
          which they appear.  If this flag is not present in the attribute type
          description, then attributes of that type will be allowed to have
          multiple distinct values in the same entry.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional "COLLECTIVE" flag, which indicates that the attributes of
          that type are assigned their values by virtue in their membership in
          some collection.  Collective attributes are described in
          <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc3671.txt">RFC 3671</a>
          (Collective Attributes in LDAP), and are one of the types of virtual
          attributes that will be supported in OpenDS.<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional "NO-USER-MODIFICATION" flag, which indicates that values
          of attributes of that type cannot be modified by external clients
          (i.e., the values may only be modified by internal processing within
          the server).<br><br></li>
      <li>An optional usage specification, which may indicate how the attribute
          type is to be used.  The allowed attribute usages include:
          <ul>
            <li><code>userApplications</code> -- Used to store user data.</li>
            <li><code>directoryOperation</code> -- Used to store data required
                for internal processing within the server.</li>
            <li><code>distributedOperation</code> -- Used to store operational
                data that must be synchronized across servers in the
                topology.</li>
            <li><code>dSAOperation</code> -- Used to store operational data
                that is specific to a particular server and should not be
                synchronized across the topology.</li>
          </ul>
          <br></li>
      <li>An optional set of extensions for the attribute type.  OpenDS
          currently uses the following extensions for attribute types:
          <ul>
            <li><code>X-ORIGIN</code> -- Provides information about where the
                attribute type is defined (e.g., whether it came from a
                particular RFC or Internet Draft, is defined within the OpenDS
                project, etc.).
            <li><code>X-SCHEMA-FILE</code> -- Indicates which schema file
                contains the attribute type definition (this is generally used
                for internal purposes only and does not get exposed to
                clients).
            <li><code>X-APPROX</code> -- Indicates which approximate matching
                rule should be used for the attribute type.  If this is
                specified, then its value should be the name or OID of a
                registered approximate matching rule.
          </ul>
          <br></li>
    </ul>

    For example, the following is the attribute type description for the
    standard <code>uid</code> attribute type:

    <blockquote>
      <code>( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1 NAME 'uid' EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
              SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
              SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{256}
              X-ORIGIN 'RFC 1274' )</code>
    </blockquote>

    In this case, the OID is "0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1".  There is a single
    human-readable name of "uid".  The caseIgnoreMatch rule should be used for
    equality matching, and the caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch rule should be used
    for substring matching.  The attribute type uses the directory string
    syntax with a suggested minimum upper bound of 256 characters, and the
    attribute type definition was taken from RFC 1274.  There is no
    description or superior type specified.  The attribute type is not marked
    OBSOLETE, SINGLE-VALUE, COLLECTIVE, or NO-USER-MODIFICATION.  There is no
    ordering matching rule specified, which means that the server will fall
    back on the default ordering rule used by the directory string syntax, and
    there is no X-APPROX extension to specify the approximate matching rule so
    the default approximate rule for the directory string syntax will be used
    there as well.

    <br><br>
    <b>Attribute Type Inheritance</b>
    <br><br>
    As noted above, one attribute type can reference another as its superior
    class.  This has two primary effects:
    <ul>
      <li>The matching rule and attribute syntax specifications from the
          superior attribute type may be inherited by the subordinate type if
          it does not override the superior definition.  For example, if the
          superior attribute type uses the "IA5 String" syntax, then the
          subordinate attribute type will also use the IA5 String syntax unless
          its definition overrides that by specifying an alternate
          syntax.  According to the specification in
          <a href="https://opends.dev.java.net/public/standards/rfc4512.txt">RFC 4512</a>,
          section 2.5.1, an attribute type may have a different syntax than its
          superior type only if the syntax for the subordinate type is a
          refinement of (i.e., allows a subset of the values of) the syntax for
          the superior attribute type.<br><br></li>
      <li>The OID and/or any of the human-readable names associated with the
          superior attribute type may be used to collectively reference all of
          the subordinate types.  For example, the name attribute type is
          referenced as the superior type for the cn, sn, c, l, st, o, ou,
          title, givenName, initials, generationQualifier, and dmdName
          attribute types.  Therefore, a filter of "<code>(name=test)</code>"
          should match an entry if any attribute with one of those types has a
          value of "test".<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    It is not allowed for a subordinate attribute type to have a different
    usage than its superior type.  That is, if the superior type is
    "userApplications", then the subordinate type must also be
    "userApplications".  Similarly, if a superior type is declared COLLECTIVE
    then the subtype must also be COLLECTIVE, but if the superior type is not
    COLLECTIVE, then the subordinate type must also not be COLLECTIVE.

    <br><br>
    <b>The OpenDS Attribute Type Implementation</b>
    <br><br>
    Attribute types in OpenDS do not require any custom logic (beyond that
    already provided by the associated attribute syntax and matching rules) and
    therefore the attribute type description provides all the information that
    the server needs to define an attribute type.  As such, all of the
    attribute types for use in the server should be specified in the schema
    configuration files.  These files exist in the <code>resource/schema</code>
    directory in the source repository, and get put in
    <code>config/schema</code> in the actual server instance.  OpenDS treats
    these files in much the same way as they are handled in the Sun Java System
    Directory Server (in fact, it should be possible to copy schema files from
    the Sun Java System Directory Server <code>config/schema</code> directory
    for an OpenDS instance, as long as there aren't any conflicts or undefined
    dependencies).

    <br><br>
    All OpenDS attribute type objects are instances of the
    <code>org.opends.server.types.AttributeType</code> class.  This class
    primarily serves as a simple data structure containing all of the
    properties of the attribute type description as specified above. Attribute
    type objects may be retrieved from the server schema using their OIDs or
    any of their human-readable names.

    <br><br>
    At the present time, the OpenDS mechanism used to handle attribute types
    varies from the LDAPv3 specification in the following ways:
    <ul>
      <li>The LDAPv3 specification states that a subordinate attribute type
          must have the same syntax as the superior type, or a refinement of
          that syntax.  OpenDS does not enforce this constraint because it does
          not have any way to determine whether one attribute syntax is a
          refinement of the syntax of the supertype.<br><br></li>
      <li>OpenDS does not yet include support for collective
          attributes.<br><br></li>
      <li>The OpenDS synchronization subsystem does not take attribute usage
          into account (e.g., so that attribute types with a usage of
          "dSAOperation" are not synchronized).<br><br></li>
    </ul>
