    <div class="secpageheader">A Possible Design for Multiple Schemas in OpenDS</div>

    <br>
    At the present time, OpenDS only contains a single set of schema elements
    that apply throughout the entire server.  The same is true for the Sun Java
    System Directory Server.  The LDAP specifications, however, do allow for
    servers to have different schemas associated with different portions of the
    DIT, and this may provide certain benefits in some cases.  Some of these
    benefits include:
    <ul>
      <li>It provides a very basic means of controlling which types of entries
          are allowed in various portions of the tree.  Although this can also
          be done with DIT content rules and DIT structure rules, these types
          of elements are not well known among users and may not be suitable
          in all environments.<br><br></li>
      <li>In some cases, the server schema may contain sensitive information
          (e.g., in a directory that serves as a hosting environment, schema
          elements specific to one organization may include the name of that
          organization, and those elements should not be visible to other
          organizations that may be sharing the same server).<br><br></li>
      <li>DIT structure rules may be most useful and effective when used in an
          environment in which each portion of the hierarchy may contain its
          own schema.<br><br></li>
      <li>In environments containing data from multiple sources (e.g., a
          virtual directory environment) the different data sources may have
          different constraints on the kind of data that may be stored
          there.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    If OpenDS does need to provide support for multiple schemas, then it will
    likely be done in the following manner:
    <ul>
      <li>There will still need to be a single global schema that contains all
          of the matching rule, attribute syntax, attribute type, and object
          class definitions.  The individual subschemas may only expose a
          subset of the attribute types and object classes, but there may not
          be any conflicting attribute type or object class definitions in
          different subschemas.<br><br></li>
      <li>The global schema may also contain other schema elements like name
          forms, DIT content rules, DIT structure rules, and matching rule
          uses, but it will be acceptable for such elements to only be defined
          in a subschema and not in the global schema.<br><br></li>
      <li>The unit of coverage for a subschema will be a backend (or possibly a
          workflow from the latest proxy/distribution/virtual discussions).  An
          individual backend may either inherit the entire global schema (which
          will be the default behavior), or it may specify a subset of the
          global schema to inherit, and only those elements will be available
          for operations in that backend, along with any backend-specific name
          forms, DIT content rules, DIT structure rules, and matching rule
          uses.<br><br></li>
      <li>Inheritance of global schema elements into a subschema will likley be
          achieved on a per-file basis for the greatest degree of simplicity.
          If a backend is to use its own subschema, then it will specify which
          global schema configuration files contain the elements that should be
          exposed in that subschema.  Each subschema may also have its own set
          of files for custom name forms, DIT content rules, DIT structure
          rules, and matching rule uses defined only within the context of that
          backend.<br><br></li>
    </ul>
