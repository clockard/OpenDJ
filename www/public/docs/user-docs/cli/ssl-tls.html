    <div class="secpageheader">Using SSL and StartTLS in OpenDS Clients</div>

    <br>
    All of the utilities provided with OpenDS that can communicate with the
    server over LDAP also support the ability to secure that communication with
    either SSL or StartTLS.

    <br><br>
    SSL (secure sockets layer) is a very common technology that is used to
    encrypt all communication that a client has with the server, from the time
    the connection is established until the time that it is closed.  If SSL is
    to be used, then the Directory Server must be configured with a connection
    handler that communicates only in SSL.  Recent versions of SSL (i.e., SSLv3
    and later) are now called TLS (transport-layer security), but it is
    important to understand that the use of TLS is not the same as the use of
    the StartTLS extended operation.

    <br><br>
    The StartTLS extended operation is a mechanism described in
    <a href="../../standards/rfc4513.txt">RFC 4513</a> that may also be used
    to secure the communication between LDAP clients and the Directory Server.
    The underlying method of protection is similar to SSL/TLS, but there is one
    notable difference:  the connection used to communicate with the server is
    not always secure.  Rather, the client will establish a connection to the
    Directory Server on the port used to perform unsecured LDAP communication
    and will then send an extended request to use the StartTLS operation.  This
    will cause the server to secure the communication, and what was once a
    clear-text communication channel is now encrypted.  This provides the
    ability to secure only a portion of the communication over an existing
    connection.  It also has the benefit of offering both secure and insecure
    communication over the same port, which can be used to ensure that clients
    do not need to be configured with a separate port for secure communication
    like they would need with SSL, and if a firewall is in place between the
    client and the server it is only necessary to allow communication on a
    single port.

    <br><br>
    <b>Blindly Trusting Any Server Certificate</b>
    <br>
    The easiest way to communicate securely with the Directory Server is to
    configure the client to automatically trust any certificate that the server
    presents to it.  However, this is also the least secure method of
    communication because this introduces the possibility of a
    man-in-the-middle attack, or for an untrusted third party to impersonate
    the server.  Therefore, it is recommended that this capability be used only
    for testing purposes, or when there is a relative degree of confidence that
    the target server may be trusted.

    <br><br>
    This "blind trust" capability may be enabled using either the
    <code>-X</code> or the <code>--trustAll</code> argument.  For example, the
    following command will retrieve the root DSE from a Directory Server over
    SSL:

    <blockquote>
      <code>ldapsearch --host server.example.com --port 636 --useSSL --trustAll
            --baseDN "" --searchScope base "(objectClass=*)"</code>
    </blockquote>

    <br>
    <b>Using a Certificate Trust Store</b>
    <br>
    A more secure way to perform secure communication with the Directory Server
    is to configure the client to use a certificate trust store, which contains
    information about the certificate(s) that it will trust.  This may be done
    using the <code>--trustStorepath</code> argument.  Whenever a server
    presents a certificate to the client, that client will check its trust
    store to see if it contains either the certificate presented by the server
    or any of the issuer certificates for that certificate.  If a match is
    found, then it will be possible to communicate securely with that server.
    If no match is found, then the server cannot be trusted and you should
    check to make sure that the presented certificate is legitimate.  If it is,
    then you can add it to the trust store and secure communication will be
    allowed.

    <br><br>
    The following command will retrieve the root DSE from a Directory Server
    using security provided with the StartTLS extended operation and a
    certificate trust store:

    <blockquote>
      <code>ldapsearch --host server.example.com --port 389 --useStartTLS
            --trustStorePath /path/to/trust.store --baseDN ""
            --searchScope base "(objectClass=*)"</code>
    </blockquote>

    Note that in some rare cases, the certificate trust store may require that
    a PIN be provided in order to access its contents.  If this is necessary,
    then that PIN may be provided directly using the
    <code>--trustStorePassword</code> argument, or you may specify a path to
    the file containing that PIN with the
    <code>--trustStorePasswordFile</code> option.

    <br><br>
    <b>Providing a Client Certificate</b>
    <br>
    In some cases, it may be necessary for the client to present its own
    certificate to the Directory Server.  This will be needed if the client
    wishes to perform SASL EXTERNAL authentication, or if the server is
    configured to always require clients to present their own certificates.  In
    this case, it will be necessary to provide information to the client about
    which certificate key store should be used.  This should be done with
    the <code>--keyStorePath</code> argument to specify the path to the file
    to use as the certificate key store.  It will almost always be the case
    that it will also be necessary to provide the PIN needed to access the
    keystore contents, which may be done by either providing the PIN directly
    with the <code>--keyStorePassword</code> argument, or by providing the path
    to a file containing the PIN with the <code>--keyStorePasswordFile</code>
    argument.

    <br><br>
    The following command will perform SASL EXTERNAL authentication over an
    SSL-based client connection to retrieve the root DSE from the server:

    <blockquote>
      <code>ldapsearch --host server.example.com --port 636 --useSSL
            --keyStorePath /path/to/key.store
            --keyStorePasswordFile /path/to/key.store.pin
            --trustStorePath /path/to/trust/store --useSASLExternal
            --baseDN "" --searchScope base "(objectClass=*)"</code>
    </blockquote>
