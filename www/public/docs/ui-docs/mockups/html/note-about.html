    <h1>About This Mockup </h1>
    <p>This is a static html mockup representing the current design direction for OpenDS Control Center, a browser-based administrative console for managing OpenDS instances. There some &quot;Design Notes&quot; in the various sections of the left navigation panel that provide more information on the planned content. The mockup is designed around the current <a href="https://www.opends.org/wiki/page/ObjectModelForMultiServerAdministration" target="_blank">Administrative Object Model</a>, which is described on the OpenDS wiki. </p>
    <p>Several important caveats to note: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The design is incomplete and in flux. There are stubs to content that will eventually get filled in (or, alternatively, the stubs might simply disappear)</li>
      <li>There are things that are broken in this mockup that won't be broken in the implementation. The implementation will be built using the JSF <a href="https://woodstock.dev.java.net/index.html" target="_blank">Woodstock components</a>, which will behave properly. This mockup uses the images, css and an approximation of the html generated by the Woodstock components to create a relatively high-fidelity representation of the real deal, but it is limited by its static nature. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>Things like keyboard navigation do not yet work properly.</li>
          <li>The browser's back button will not work properly --  this is due to the nature of the javascript used to load links. </li>
          <li>Likewise, reloading the page will bring you back to this page. </li>
          <li>For simplicity's sake, the mockup was designed using Firefox as the primary test platform. It'll probably look OK on other browsers, but then again it may not.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
