    <h1>Global Logs </h1>
    <p>Given that the logs  are configured and live at the server level (via loggers), it may not be feasible to present logs  in an aggregate manner at the global level, but the idea here is to provide a top-level mechanism for viewing/searching logs across servers. The goal is to avoid having to drill in and back out of each individual server of interest in order to   correlate log events and identify patterns. </p>
    <p>The panel contains the three default categories of logs: error, access and audit, but could also potentially contain some user-defined log views based on the output of  custom loggers. </p>
