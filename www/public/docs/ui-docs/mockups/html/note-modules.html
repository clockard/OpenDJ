    <h1>Service Modules</h1>
    <p><strong>Service Modules </strong> are the components of a Directory Service that provide specialized functionality, such as ldap service, changelog/replication, distribeution, virtualization, Load Balancer and so on. These are configured and managed independently of one another and from the server that hosts them. The modules are   combined in whatever way the user sees fit in order to provide the directory service. Multiple Service Modules can be running on a single server instance or a server could be dedicated to running a single module.</p>
    <p>One of the goals behind this module approach is that it should be able to support the myriad configuration options available via the functionality provided in OpenDS but to do it in a consistent, function-based way. In this scenario, each specialized module is responsible for a particular piece of the overall service. These can live in one server on one host or be spread across multiple servers on multiple hosts since any number of such schemes can be configured to provide functionally-equivalent service. </p>
    <p>The Service Modules sub-panel contains the names of the types of modules that can be configured. No individual modules will be listed in this panel, primarily for reasons of scale. When a user clicks on a particular category a table containing all modules of that given type will be presented in the right hand pane. All of that type will be shown in the table independent of which Directory Services they take part it or which server happens to contain them. The All Server Modules item will show all known modules in a single table.</p>
