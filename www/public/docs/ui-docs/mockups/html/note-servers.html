    <h1>Servers</h1>
    <p><strong>Servers</strong> are really the workhorses of an OpenDS Directory Service. Servers host Service Modules and provide logistical support for the modules in that they  are responsible for listening on ports, logging, certificate management, etc. The server is the entity that is started, stopped, upgraded, maintained and so on. </p>
    <p>Much of the  configuration in initial deployment will take place at the server level. Configuration changes to the directory service and things like performance tuning (e.g., cache adjustments) would take place at the Service  level rather than at the Server level. </p>
    <p>As was pointed out in the Directory Service design notes, Servers can be abstracted out of the views to just show the Service Modules that comprise a Directory Service -- this is useful when there is more than one Service  running on a server, as we might expect to be the case with the changelog/replication service modules. </p>
    <p>The items in this panel are not going to be individual servers, mostly for reasons of scale and complexity. Rather they will be <strong>Server Groups</strong> which are defined and created by users. There will always be an All Servers item that will display a table listing all of the servers in the right-hand pane of the window. </p>
