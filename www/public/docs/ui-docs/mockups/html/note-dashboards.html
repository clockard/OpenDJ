<h1>Dashboards</h1>
<p>The idea here is to have some canned &quot;dashboards&quot; showing various monitorable aspects of the Directory Service. These could provide a quick way to determine at a high level and at a glance if the critical components of the service are OK. A graphical representation that supports drill-down into the components would be a nice way to accomplish this. </p>
<p>At some point it would be cool if these could be customizable and configurable. </p>
