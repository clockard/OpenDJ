    <h1>Directory Data </h1>
    <p>The idea here is to provide a means to search or browse the various entries served up by the directory services. This probably wouldn't be used for full-scale entry management, but really more to support troubleshooting and maintenance tasks, e.g., testing a configuration to make sure it is serving up the expected results, looking for duplicate entries and so forth. There could also be rudimentary support for creating new entries. </p>
